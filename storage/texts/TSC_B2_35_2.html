    <p><span>Have You Made Any New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions?</span></p>
    
    <p><span>How do you expect your efforts to go this year?</span></p>
    
    <p><span>My name is Betty. Each year, I try to list down changes I&#39;d like to make in my
            life.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>I am planning a different approach this year.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>Last year, I was out of sight for things that matter. I can say, I worked a lot and
            neglected some personal time.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>I missed several gatherings for working overtime.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>I barely visit my parents.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>This year, I want to change that. I would like to add in having a healthier approach
            to my diet.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>I am planning to cut down on junk foods and consume foods that are good for my
            heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>I will also be likely to sign up for a gym membership. It will be a good
            motivation.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>Plus, I am trying to develop some muscles. I will really make an effort to drink my
            supplements!&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>According to a quote I read, &quot;Cheers to a new year, another chance for us to get
            it right.&quot;</span></p>
    <p><span>I need to have the sense of commitment to be a better version of myself.&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p><span>I need to forget the manners that damaged myself physically and
            mentally.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>I hope I can make smart choices and stick to my resolutions this year.</span></p>
    <p><span>I will be a learner everyday!&nbsp;</span></p>
