	<p><b>You
			will read a conversion of a group of friends of what criteria they
			were looking for if they want to have a partner?</b></p>

	<p>Mara:
		</span>I would like to meet a guy
		who has fair-haired and green-eyed because I love Irish people and
		their culture. I have met a guy before. I can't forget him because he
		is so special. He is always heart-warming to homeless kids. He joined
		the charity for children and he usually volunteers every time they
		have a charity event.</p>

	<p>Ana:</span>That
		is so nice of him, well for me, It doesnâ€™t matter what he looks
		like, but what is eye-catching is to have a partner who has a good
		sense of humor where he can be along with different people. Its
		difficult to understand different people and other cultures having
		this kind of personality is a talent.</p>

	<p>Lea:
		</span>I totally agree, I think
		what is mind-blowing for me is to meet a guy who is religious and
		very sophisticated, because nowadays it's very rare to meet people
		who are religious and mostly we lose this kind of custom. Because of
		our new generation. Hopefully for young people they will still learn
		this from their parents. To preserve our cultural values.</p>
