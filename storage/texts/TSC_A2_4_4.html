      Karen: I don&rsquo;t like this car. I like that blue one over there.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Anna: You are right. That blue one is bigger than the other one. But, Look
      at the jeans I am wearing, these are my favorite.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Karen: But Anna, Those black shoes you are wearing look ugly. You should
      wear the same color as your shirt.
    </p>

    <p>Anna: I do like these shoes.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Karen: Can you see that yellow bag near the counter, that looks
      beautiful!&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Anna: No, I think you are talking about that blue bag near the
      counter.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Karen: Anna, Is that your mother wearing that green sweatshirt?</p>
