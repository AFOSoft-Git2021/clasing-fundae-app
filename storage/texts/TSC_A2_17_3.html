    <p>I think that Paris is the most wonderful city in the world.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>This is the best place for couples. It is certainly the most romantic. It has some of
        the best art museums in the world.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It also has some of the most interesting architecture, such as the Eiffel
        tower.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The Eiffel tower is the most famous building in Paris. Then there is French
        food.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been to many cities and Paris has the best restaurants.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>They can also have the greatest chef.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Of course, Paris is not the cheapest place to visit.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>It has the most expensive hotels.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>It might be the most expensive trip I have ever had but this is the worthiest for
        me.&nbsp;</p>
