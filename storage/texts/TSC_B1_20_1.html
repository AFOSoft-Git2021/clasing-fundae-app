    <h3 class="ReferenciaInterna">Questions: TSC-B1_20_1 until B1_20_10</h3>

    <p>My name is Judy. It&rsquo;s a Saturday afternoon. I am planning a lot of things to do
        today. I plan to see Debby, she is a friend of mine.</p>

    <p>We love playing hide-and-seek. It is a game where one player should cover his or her
        eyes while other players hide.</p>

    <p>If this person sees a player hiding, she must call his name, they have to run in
        their home base. The player who is left behind will be the one who will cover his eyes for the next
        round.</p>
    <p>We also enjoy playing the hopscotch game. A player has to hop in the first empty
        hopscotch square. You have to balance yourself on one foot. I always find it difficult to balance
        mine. But Debby, that body of hers, it is easy for
        her to do it.</p>

    <p>In the hopscotch game, if the player loses his or her balance, they have to return to
        the first line.</p>

    <p>At my age or yours, this is a good game for us to master body control.
    </p>

    <p>The way I balance myself can be different than yours.</p>

    <p>Everyday is ours to spend as we pleased.</p>
