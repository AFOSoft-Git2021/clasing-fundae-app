    <p>My friends and I</p>

    <p>I was sitting on the curb, drinking a Slurpee. It was a summer afternoon, I wanted to
        end it all; I want to end my life.</p>

    <p>Since the boy I had loved left me, life had been nothing but a nightmare. Well,
        almost a complete nightmare.</p>

    <p>I still had people that cared about me, like Jennifer and Carah and Anna. They were
        the only good friends I had left.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Hey Ashley,&rdquo; said Carah, noticing that I was staring out to the sunset
        by myself with my eyes starting to water, &ldquo;Whatcha doing?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; I said. I normally didn&rsquo;t talk back then, not since he had
        left, &ldquo;Just thinking, it&rsquo;s okay. Nothing to worry about Carah,&rdquo; and I had to fake my smile
        to Carah.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well, ok,&rdquo; said Carah, still worried about me.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I wonder why everyone is trying to be there for me. I wasn&rsquo;t popular.
        I wasn&rsquo;t rich.</p>

    <p>So why did all those people want to be around me? I took another sip from my drink. I
        looked up as a car beeped. It was Anna&rsquo;s mom indicating that she was about to take off.
    </p>

    <p>Jennifer walked toward me from across the street as she finished saying goodbye to
        Anna.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Hey Ashley,&rdquo; said Jennifer trying to cheer me up. &ldquo;You want to go
        to 7-eleven to get some Shark Gushers?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; I said then Carah got up from my front lawn and stumbled over to
        me and Jennifer.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Whoa! Oh my God, my leg fell asleep. Ha-ha,&rdquo; said Carah, smiling even
        though her leg would end up causing her some damage, &ldquo;Were you guys about to go to 7-Eleven without
        me?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Jennifer turned to me smiling, waiting for me to smile back. I felt bad. I
        hadn&rsquo;t smiled a real smile since he had left, so I decided to pity myself and my friends by cracking a
        smile.</p>

    <p>I am glad that after a heartbreak, I have myself real friends to be
        with.</p>
