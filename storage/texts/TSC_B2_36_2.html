    <p><span>Putting an end to wasteful packaging, boosting reuse and recycling</span></p>
    
    <p><span>On average, each European generates almost 180 kg of packaging waste per year.
            Packaging is one of the main users of virgin materials as 40% of plastics and 50% of paper used in the EU is
            destined for packaging.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>The new rules aim to stop this trend.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span
           >For consumers, they should ensure reusable packaging options</span><span>,</span><span
           >&nbsp;they should get rid of unnecessary packaging, limit overpackaging, and provide clear labels
            to support correct recycling.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>For the industry, they will create new business opportunities, especially for smaller
            companies, decrease the need for virgin materials, boosting Europe&#39;s recycling capacity.</span></p>
    <p><span>The new rule will make Europe less dependent on primary resources and external
            suppliers. They will put the packaging sector on track for climate neutrality by 2050.</span></p>
    <p><span>The Commission will bring clarity to consumers and industry about biobased,
            compostable and biodegradable plastics.</span></p>
    <p><span>Single-use packaging industries will have to invest into a transition.</span></p>
    <p><span>Biomass used to produce biobased plastics must be sustainably sourced.&nbsp;</span>
