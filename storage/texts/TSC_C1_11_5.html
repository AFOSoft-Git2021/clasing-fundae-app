		Attention
			employees,
	</p>

	<p>
		Unfortunately,
			We have been making adjustments to our policies concerning sick leave
			here at Zimnet Corporation. 
	</p>

	<p>
		We
			have been reducing the number of paid vacation days and instead we
			have been increasing the number of paid sick days available to
			employees. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Before
			we make any changes, we have been gathering the opinions of employees
			on this matter. 
	</p>


	<p>
		Please email Tony Nugent at <a href="mailto:tonynugent@zimnet.com"> <u>tonynugent@zimnet.com</u></a>
		 to add your suggestion. 
	</p>

	<p>
		He has been collecting and analyzing your responses. 
	</p>

	<p>
		All departments have been scheduling meetings regarding these changes. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I hope this process can be helpful to all of our employees, and please
			be active in your participation.
	</p>

	<p>
		Sincerely,
	</p>
	<p>
		Elizabeth Paine
