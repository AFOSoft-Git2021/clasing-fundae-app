	<p> Our next guest speaker is Gary Hardwell, CEO of Broadbank industries. His company is responsible for
		funding our latest work, building wells in Africa. </p>


	<p> The value of his contributions is a game changer and can be seen on the walls of his office.</p>


	<p> These pictures in the wall in a nutshell are villages he has provided with clean drinking water. </p>


	<p> In the last year, Broadbank Industries has donated over 12 million dollars and built over 3000 wells
		across the poorest regions of Africa. </p>


	<p> This has grown into Mr. Hardwell’s greatest passion, and he now spends about six months of each year in
		Africa rolling up his sleeves and overseeing his workers and ensuring his money is being spent in
		the right places.
	</p>


	<p> I think it’s safe to say that Mr. Hardwell should leave some room on his walls.
	</p>


	<p> In the next year, he intends to bring to the table to increase the well production by 10 percent.
	</p>


	<p> He has written a book about his experiences titled Water is Life: Giving Back to the World.
	</p>


	<p> In a jiffy, he will preview the book and show us some video footage of the work he is doing in Africa.
		Please put your hands together for Mr. Hardwell.</p>
