    <p><strong>Raven: </strong>I had been seeing your posts about your new dog.</p>
    <p><strong>Yuki: </strong>Yeah. I had been walking him for an hour. His name is Yorko.</p>
    <p><strong>Raven: </strong>Has Yorko been barking a lot in the past few weeks?</p>
    <p><strong>Yuki: </strong>Yorko had been barking a lot recently. He's healthy it seems.</p>
    <p><strong>Raven: </strong>That's good news. Had you been feeling lonely before you met Yorko?</p>
    <p><strong>Yuki: </strong>I hadn't been feeling well before I met Yorko. I had been feeling great since I met Yorko. Yorko had been taking good care of my mental health. We had been spending most of our time together. How about you? Had you been working at the same job?</p>
    <p><strong>Raven: </strong>I quit that job. I had been looking for a new job before I quit. I just got a new job at a new studio. I had been listening to boring songs for three hours. I had been singing different kinds of songs for an hour.</p>
    <p><strong>Yuki: </strong>Where had you been staying before you quit your last job?</p>
    <p><strong>Raven: </strong>I had been staying at my brother's place for a while now.</p>
