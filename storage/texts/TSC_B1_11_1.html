    <p>Lani:&nbsp;Hey, Eric. Are you attending the party tomorrow?&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Eric:&nbsp;I am unsure if I will be attending the party. What about you?
    </p>

    <p>
      Lani:&nbsp;I need to go, whether I like it or not. Bob is asking me to
      prepare the tables.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Eric:&nbsp;As if you could say no to Bob, that guy is persuasive.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Lani:&nbsp;That&rsquo;s alright. I am actually not sure if I will buy
      anything to set the table.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Eric:&nbsp;Didn&rsquo;t you ask Bob?</p>

    <p>
      Lani: I am waiting for his reply actually. What&#39;s the weather
      tomorrow? Do you think it is gonna rain tomorrow? It is hard to tell
      whether it will rain or not.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Eric:&nbsp;If only I can predict the future but I heard the news, it is
      going to be cloudy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lani:&nbsp;I wonder if everyone on the invitation list will come.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Eric:&nbsp;Not so sure. I actually have to decide if I will leave work
      early, so I can help you guys.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Lani: You don&rsquo;t have to do that. I will call you if I need any help
      at the party.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Eric:&nbsp;What if we call Matt to help us?&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Lani:&nbsp;As if he can lift a chair. He is not the person to do such a
      thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eric:&nbsp;Honestly,&nbsp;whether you like it or not, you don&rsquo;t have
      any options.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Lani:&nbsp;You are right. I will push him so hard if he will not help me
      carry things.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Eric:&nbsp;It is hard to tell whether you are being serious or not.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Lani:&nbsp;Well, I am! I couldn&rsquo;t care less if we are going to be at
      Bob&rsquo;s party, I will argue with Matt!
    </p>
