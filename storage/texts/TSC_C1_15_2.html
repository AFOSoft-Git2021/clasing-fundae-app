		<b>Questions: TSC-C1_15_6 until C1_15_10</b>
	</h3>
		
	<p>To:
		All staff</p>
	<p>From:
		Susan Ward</p>
	<p>Subject:
		Employee handbook</p>
	<p>Date:
		April 15</p>
	<p>Thank
		you to everyone who participated in the discussions with company
		management.
	</p>
	<p>Your
		comments about some employees being unaware of the procedures for
		day-to-day operations are being documented.</p>
	
	<p>The
		management is believed to have been working to address the situation.</p>
	
	<p>For
		starters, we have arranged personnel to be publishing the company's
		standard operating procedures as soon as possible.
	</p>
	
	<p>A
		guide is being printed to be given to management and staff an
		official reference on the performance of daily tasks.
	</p>
	
	<p>Hopefully,
		it will help move us closer to our goal of having firmly established
		policies.</p>
	<p>If
		any revisions are required, these will be incorporated into a later
		version of the manual.
	</p>
	<p>The
		final version is being arranged to be accessible through the
		company's internal network.
	</p>
	
	<p>If
		you have any questions, please direct them to your departmental
		supervisors.</p>
