    <h2>A great summer vacation</h2>
    <p>
      I just returned from the greatest summer vacation! It was so fantastic, I
      never wanted it to end. I spent eight days in Paris, France. My best
      friends, Henry and Steve, went with me. We had a beautiful hotel room in
      the Latin Quarter, and it wasn&rsquo;t even expensive. We had a balcony
      with a wonderful view.

      We visited many famous tourist places. My favourite was the Louvre, a
      well-known museum. I was always interested in art, so that was a special
      treat for me. The museum is so huge, you could spend weeks there. Henry
      got tired walking around the museum and said &ldquo;Enough! I need to take
      a break and rest.&rdquo;

      We took lots of breaks and sat in cafes along the river Seine. The French
      food we ate was delicious. The wines were tasty, too. Steve&rsquo;s
      favourite part of the vacation was the hotel breakfast. He said he would
      be happy if he could eat croissants like those forever. We had so much fun
      that we&rsquo;re already talking about our next vacation!
