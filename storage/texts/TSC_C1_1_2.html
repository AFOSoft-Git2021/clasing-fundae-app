	<p>Dear Sarah,</p>

	<p>I would like to tell you a story about a man that I met yesterday. He
		was tall and had fair complexion skin with long hair. He looked very
		popular in the village, he has a body guard that wears a bullet-proof
		vest. He works for him part-time. We talked alot about his brand-new
		materials that he sells from his business. Anyway, I found that he
		was really a good-looking man. I'm looking forward to getting to know
		him more. I will tell you more stories once I get back.</p>

	<p>Your
		Best Friend,</p>

	<p>Carla</p>
