		Renovations</p>

	<p>Dear
		Ms. Park,</p>

	<p>The
		kitchen has undergone renovation. Old appliances and equipment have
		been replaced with new ones. The new set of appliances and equipment
		have carried more sandwiches and prepared more lunch boxes.</p>

	<p>The
		renovation has increased the space inside the kitchen. The space has
		provided room for new stovetops and ovens. The renovation has changed
		the pace. It made it easier for us to prepare meals.</p>

	<p>Best
		regards,</p>
	<p>The
		Team.</p>
