    <p>Dear diary,</p>

    <p>Today is a terrible day. I lost my money.</p>

    <p>I wish I hadn&rsquo;t forgotten where I put my money. I wish I had spent it on
        food.</p>

    <p>My friend transferred to a different school. I wish we had sung our favorite song
        before she left. I&rsquo;ll always treasure our memories. But I wish we had spent more time together.
    </p>

    <p>We had a surprise exam today. I wish I had studied our last lesson. Today was the
        submission of our assignment. I wish I hadn&rsquo;t forgotten to do my homework.</p>

    <p>I didn&rsquo;t have the energy to listen to the discussion. I wish I had slept
        more. I was late for the first time. I wish I hadn&rsquo;t stayed up late last night.</p>
    <p>I saw a guitar that was on sale on the way home. I
        wish I had found my money. Today is not the best. I wish I had made better decisions. </p>
    <p>But that&rsquo;s life; today might not be great, but who knows what tomorrow
        brings?</p>
