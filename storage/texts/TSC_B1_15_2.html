    <p>One night, three thieves are in a rich man&rsquo;s house. They will steal some money
        from him.</p>

    <p>The first man will watch the door if someone enters, the second man will put the
        money in the bag.</p>

    <p>The third man got hungry and said &quot;I shall check the fridge for
        food.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The first man said &#39;Don&#39;t take too long to check the fridge, maybe the rich
        man will be back soon.&#39;</p>

    <p>Shall we take some jewelry, the second man asked. It will make us richer if we take
        his expensive watches and rings.</p>

    <p>Will those watches and rings be harder to carry? The first man asked.
    </p>

    <p>While the two are busy taking things and stealing money, the man who checked for food
        wasn&#39;t around for a long time.</p>

    <p>The first man said &quot;You stay here, I will look for the third man, he is taking
        so long.&quot;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I took all the things we needed, we shall leave at 6&rdquo;, said the second
        man. </p>
