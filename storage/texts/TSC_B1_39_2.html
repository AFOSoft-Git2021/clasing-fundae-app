    <p>Dear diary,</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I earned a scholarship because of my academic excellence. I'm enrolled in a highly respected private school.</p>
    <p>I'm still adjusting to the campus. It's huge. From what I heard, the tuition here costs a lot.</p>
    <p>This school is awesome. They offer vocational courses. They also offer online courses for students who live far away.</p>
    <p>It's the first day but they already gave us assignments. Well, that's what you'd expect from a highly respected school.</p>
    <p>We have a quiz tomorrow. I have to review the lessons if I want to score well tomorrow.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Yours,</p>
    <p>Emily.</p>
