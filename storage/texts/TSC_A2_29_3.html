    <p>Being Nice to Others</p>

    <p>Being polite is awesome. Saying &ldquo;Please&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; is
        way cool and it shows you appreciate people when they help you.</p>

    <p>Always show good manners by saying &ldquo;Yes sir&rdquo; or &ldquo;Yes
        ma&rsquo;am&rdquo; when speaking to adults, especially parents and teachers.</p>

    <p>Holding the door for someone, allowing others to go first, or giving up your seat to
        an elderly person on a bus are all acts of courtesy.</p>

    <p>It shows you are considerate and thoughtful of others.</p>

    <p>The best part about being courteous is that people will see you in a good way and you
        will make more friends.</p>

    <p>If you are not sure, try to imagine being in the situation you are dealing
        with, but from the point of view of the other person,</p>
    <p>This can help a lot in understanding the importance of showing courtesy, when it
        could well be you on the other side of your behavior.</p>

    <p>We don&rsquo;t like it when other people aren&rsquo;t nice to us.</p>
    <p>However, if we continue the cycle by not being nice either, then we aren&rsquo;t
        changing the world at all.</p>

    <p>If we can be a better example of courtesy, it might help others to show it more, as
        well as prevent many instances of trouble.</p>
