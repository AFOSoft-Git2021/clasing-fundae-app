    <h1>Dialogue A</h1>

    <p>Thomas: Could you give me that book on the table over there, please?</p>

    <p>Esther: Do you mean this Science book?</p>

    <p>Thomas: Yes, that book!</p>

    <p>
      Esther: Here you are. Oh, and could you give me those magazines on top of
      the chair?
    </p>

    <p>Thomas: These magazines about the new park in town.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Esther: Yes, that one. Also, what about that black notebook beside those
      magazines, I think someone left it.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Thomas: You are right, someone left it. We have to talk to that student
      over there, maybe it&#39;s hers.&nbsp;
