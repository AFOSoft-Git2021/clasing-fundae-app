    <h1>Our vacation</h1>

    <p>
      Last summer, we decided to spend our vacation at the beach because the
      weather was very hot in the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The travel agent said that traveling by bus was the cheapest way, but we
      went by plane because it was faster.
    </p>
    <p>We wanted to have more time to spend at the beach.</p>
    <p>The weather was beautiful and we had a great time.</p>
