	<p><b>Rural Community Outreach Program</b></p>

	<p>What
		we have is an ongoing commitment to enhance the standard of living in
		rural communities across the state. The Institute of Rural Service
		provides annual grants for rural communities.
	</p>
	<p>Not
		only is our goal to support local efforts to sustain convenience but
		to satisfy life in the countryside.
	</p>
	<p>The
		grants available this year are as follows:</p>

	<p>Business
		Development Grant: 250,000 dollars
	</p>
	<p>Community
		Development Grant: 150,000 dollars
	</p>
	<p>Communications
		Development Grant: 200,000 dollars</p>
	<p>Educational
		Development Grant: 100,000 dollars
	</p>
	<p>What
				we will give priority are proposals that reflect a comprehensive
				approach to community development.
	</p>
	<p>The
		people who are promoting community engagement will be given
		assistance.
	</p>
	<p>What
		we need is to make rural communities a better place to live and work.

	</p>

	<p>What
		we will allow is all rural communities to take the first step toward
		a project or plan.
	</p>
	<p>It
		is the rural community members that will have their lives improved.
	</p>
	<p>The
		grants were what they used in the past decades for community needs.
	</p>

	<p>Not
		only as state-of- the-art farming equipment, road maintenance,
		communications infrastructure, educational facilities, but
		investments for young rural entrepreneurs.</p>
	<p>You
		have to download this application that will help you to apply for a
		grant.
	</p>
	<p>The
		deadline for submission is February 28.</p>
