    <p>Yesterday, it was raining and thundering all day.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Ann was playing inside the house. She wanted to be outside. She wasn&#39;t
      playing outside because it was raining.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>She was feeling tired of being trapped inside the house.</p>

    <p>
      Ann was trying to keep busy inside the house. She was reading her book
      until the electricity went out.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, she decided to practice sewing. She was practicing sewing until
      lunchtime.
    </p>

    <p>After lunch, she sat by the window and watched the rain.</p>

    <p>
      While Ann was watching the rain, the phone rang. Her mother was calling to
      say she was coming home.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      She was bringing a new game. Ann and her mother were also eating ice
      cream.
    </p>

    <p>While they were playing, the rain stopped!&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      But Ann didn&#39;t even notice. She was having such a good time with her
      mom.
