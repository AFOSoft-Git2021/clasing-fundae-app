    <p>Dear diary,</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m really bored today. I don&rsquo;t know what to do
        to pass the time. I want to play football, but I always get tired midway through.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m exhausted after walking home. I don&rsquo;t feel like going outside to
        play.</p>

    <p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll just surf the web while I listen to music.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m currently interested in different breathing techniques. I&rsquo;ll do some
        research about it while I listen to my playlist.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m fascinated whenever I listen to music. It makes me wonder how artists
        compose their music. I feel relaxed when I hear the guitar playing. I&rsquo;m moved when I hear and feel
        their emotions.</p>

    <p>I get overwhelmed whenever I listen to music while someone is talking to me.
        I&rsquo;m excited to hear my friends&rsquo; stories but not while I&#39;m listening to music.</p>

    <p>I feel troubled when I think about the future. One time, my cat disturbed me while I
        was thinking about the future. I felt thankful when my cat comforted me.</p>

    <p>Sometimes my cat gets frustrated when I play my playlist on the speaker. I think my
        cat is annoyed with the noise. Since then, I&#39;ve been wearing headphones. I don&rsquo;t want my cat to
        feel threatened.</p>

    <p>Yours,</p>
    <p>Luke.</p>
