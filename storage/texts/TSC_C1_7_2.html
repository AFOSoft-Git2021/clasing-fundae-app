	<p>Dear
		Mr. Mayer,</p>

	<p>I
		am Mark Dale, CEO and founder of MarkGraphics. I saw your

		various small businesses and companies. We have tackled various
		design difficulties.

	<p>I&rsquo;m
		interested in working with your company. I hope your wounds with us
		have mended. I hope we can build a beneficial partnership. I look
		forward to your reply.</p>
