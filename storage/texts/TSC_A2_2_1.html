      One night a little rabbit was very tired from a very long journey.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>From afar, he noticed something.</p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s a wooden chest between the flowers&rdquo;, he
      said.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice place to rest&rdquo; he thought.</p>

    <p>So, the rabbit ran hurriedly towards the chest.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>When he got there, the little rabbit sat on it to rest.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>He looked above the sky and started counting the stars.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>He went off to sleep.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Suddenly, a loud voice came up! It startled the rabbit.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>It was a very hungry tiger.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The rabbit jumped. He started to run around the chest.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>After that, he hid under the chest.</p>

    <p>He ran beside the chest.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>He hopped in front of the chest.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Lastly, He even hid behind the chest.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Suddenly, he thought of a safe place to hide from the hungry tiger!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I will hide in the chest!&rdquo;, he thought.</p>
