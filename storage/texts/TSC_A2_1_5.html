    <p>Danie is going to play around the park with her friends.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      She wanted to bring toys that her mother bought but she seems to have
      forgotten where it is.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Danie was looking everywhere for it.</p>

    <p>
      She searched inside her toy box but couldn&rsquo;t find it there.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      She went downstairs where the kitchen is located, there she found the ball
      near the cupboard.&nbsp;
