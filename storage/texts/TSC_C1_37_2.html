	<p>Dear diary,</p>

	<p>Today, I staggered while I was trying to learn how to skid on my bike. I wasn’t careful enough and plunged down a steep slope. I sprawled on the dirt before carefully standing up. My body was in tremendous pain. It’s as if someone trampled on it.
	</p>

	<p>My body went limp but I saw a pile of leaves. I had a nice canter around the leaves as if I hadn't taken a
			fall. I took long, nice strides. I stumbled and fell after a good three minutes of running around. I felt
			alive. I jumped and bounced off the ground.</p>

	<p>I had so much fun that I had to hobble back to my bike. On the way back, I had to wade through the deep piles
			of leaves. My feet were in so much pain. I decided to walk the way home. I enjoyed the amble in the
			park. </p>

	<p>I’d go and practice my skid as soon as I heal from my injury. I hope I plunge into another fortunately,
								unfortunate event.</p>


	<p>Sincerely, </p>


	<p>Matt. </p>
