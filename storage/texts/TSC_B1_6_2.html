    <p>Ana:&nbsp;What do you want to do today?</p>

    <p>
      Dave:&nbsp;We could try to do something relaxing, like reading a book.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ana:&nbsp;Hmm.. I don&rsquo;t like reading books right now. I feel like we
      can play a sport, like volleyball or tennis.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Dave:&nbsp;I am not as sporty as you are.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Ana:&nbsp;Well, you can try to play basketball. I am not as tall as you
      are.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Dave:&nbsp;Basketball seems like a difficult sport to play.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Ana:&nbsp;It is. What about if we eat somewhere? We can try some Asian
      food, such as sushi, it tastes good.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Dave:&nbsp;Hmm. I don&rsquo;t really like to eat at the moment, not that
      hungry.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Ana:&nbsp;You are like your brother, always on a diet.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Dave:&nbsp;No, not really. I just want something to drink, like an orange
      juice or an apple juice.&nbsp;
