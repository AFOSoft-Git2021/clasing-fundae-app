	<p>Woman:
		Hi, Josh. You work at Sentry Insurance, don&rsquo;t you?
	</p>
	<p>I

	</p>
	<p>The
		positions have been being handled carefully?
	</p>

	<p>Man:
		Yes, no problem. I will be keeping my position.
	</p>
	<p>In
		fact, the company&rsquo;s system has been being managed carefully. We
		are planning to expand internationally.
	</p>
	<p>I&rsquo;m
		certain it will be beneficial for both me and my company.</p>

	<p>Woman:
		I&rsquo;m glad to hear that.
	</p>
	<p>Actually,
		the idea of changing my company has been being planned.
	</p>
	<p>Will
		there be any opportunities for getting hired at your company?</p>
