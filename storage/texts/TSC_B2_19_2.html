    <p><span>Dear diary,</span></p>
    
    <p><span>My two cats are alike. The male is named Yoshi and the female is Yoru. Yoshi meows
            like Yoru. Their voices are alike. The only difference is that Yoshi doesn&rsquo;t run like Yoru.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>The name &ldquo;Yoru&rdquo; means night. She has eyes like the night. The name
            &ldquo;Yoshi&rdquo; means intelligent. He has a brain like a genius.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Their claws are alike. It&rsquo;s very sharp. Their favourite foods are alike. They
            love fish and chicken.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Yoru gives a stare like his dad. Yoshi sleeps like his dad.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Sincerely,</span></p>
    <p><span>Richard.</span></p>
