	<p>Dear
		Mr. Mendoza,</p>

	<p>Having
		been inspected turned out to be great for you. Having been assessed,
		it has verified that all labor laws are followed. Having been
		evaluated with no major problems helped you pass the inspection. The
		inspectors, having been treated with respect and cooperation, were
		deemed happy. After having been provided access to any part of the
		factory, the inspection started running smoothly. The workers, having
		been compensated properly, passed the inspection.
	</p>
	<p>Thank
		you for your cooperation.</p>

	<p>Caitlyn
		Faith</p>
	<p>Inspection
		team leader</p>
