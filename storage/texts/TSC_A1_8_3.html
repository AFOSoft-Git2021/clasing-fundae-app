    <p>PROFESSOR AUSTIN:&nbsp;Good morning, James. I am doing well. And you?</p>
    <p>
      JAMES:&nbsp;I&rsquo;m great, thank you. This is my friend Emma. She is
      thinking about applying to this college. She has a few questions. Would
      you mind telling us about the process, please?
    </p>
    <p>

      I&rsquo;m more than happy to speak with you. Please stop by my office next
      week.

      for helping us.
