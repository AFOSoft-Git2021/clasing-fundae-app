	<p>Employee
		Spring Training</p>

	<p>Lawrence
		Paper is certainly dedicated to helping all of its employees fulfill
		their potential. That is why we have once again organized 2 days of
		spring training.
	</p>
	<p>Fortunately,
		Human Resources has put together a wide range of topics for this
		year&rsquo;s workshops, Including, sales techniques, computer skills,
		communication strategies, and certainly goal setting.
	</p>
	<p>Unfortunately,
		we have limited slots left for other areas. If there is anything you
		want to learn, let us know.
	</p>
	<p>It&rsquo;s
		quite possible we could incorporate it into this year&rsquo;s spring
		training.
	</p>

	<p>Thankfully,
		we have Nancy Kensington to assist us.
	</p>
	<p>Feel
		free to submit any ideas you might have to Nancy Kensington in the
		human resources department.</p>
