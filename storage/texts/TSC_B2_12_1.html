    <p>Mary: Hey Linda, do you wish you could fly?</p>

    <p>Linda: No, I don&rsquo;t wish I could fly. Why do you wish
        you could fly?</p>

    <p>Mary: I wish I could fly so that I could travel across the
        world.</p>

    <p>Linda: I also wish I could travel the world. We can travel by
        plane.</p>

    <p>Mary: That costs a lot of money. Now I wish I could be a
        billionaire.</p>

    <p>Linda: That&rsquo;s cool but do you ever wish you could be a
        guy?</p>

    <p>Mary: No, why would you wish you could be a guy?</p>

    <p>Linda: I wish I could be a guy so I could just be topless
        when I go for a swim.</p>

    <p>Mary: Why are we talking about this in the middle of the
        class? Now I wish I could go home.</p>
