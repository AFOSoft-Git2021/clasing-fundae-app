	<p>
		<b>Nina:
		</b>So
		you remember I was reading the paper earlier, at a glance, I already
		knew it was you in the edition of student&rsquo;s favorite artist of
		the month.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Oliver:
		</b>I&rsquo;m
		surprised they put it out so quickly. It should have been published
		last month. We had to work on editing some stuff. At last, they
		approved my cover letter.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Nina:
		</b>Luck
		knocks once at least at every man's gate.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Oliver:
		</b>Loving
		that quote, you are right. At times, you&rsquo;ve got to be patient
		enough to let things work out on their own.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Oliver:
		</b>What
		about you, how&rsquo;s the cheering practice so far?
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Nina:
		</b>Well,
		there are some stunts we have to learn at risk. We should be
		preparing medical assistance in advance.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Oliver:
		</b>Gosh,
		I hope not. You don&rsquo;t have to be in a hurry to learn the
		stunts. As long as you put safety first.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Nina:
		</b>Thanks
		for the heads up. We wanted to do something new for this year&rsquo;s
		cheering squad, just for a change, you know.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Oliver:
		</b>You
		being in charge, your team will definitely win this!
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Nina:
		</b>Maybe
		luck will knock on my door by accident this time.
	</p>
