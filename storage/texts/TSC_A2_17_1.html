    <p>Richard is the unluckiest boy in the world.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>He never gets sick but it happens when his class goes on the most exciting school
        trip one can imagine.</p>

    <p>He is a good student but when he has an important class test, he always forgets his
        ink.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>He has a bird, it is the best singing bird he has. But when his friends come to see
        the bird, his bird becomes the most silent bird of all.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Even if people think Richard is the unluckiest boy. Richard thinks he is very
        lucky.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>He has the most wonderful parents.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Richard is always happy because he has a great heart. He&rsquo;s the most
        generous</p>
    <p>boy in town.</p>
    <p>One day, he saw a man in the street. He looked hungry. Richard thinks he is the
        poorest man in the world.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>He bought the man some food.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The man smiles and says &ldquo;&nbsp; Thank you very much. You are very generous.
        But&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not a poor man. I&rsquo;m the richest man in town and I sometimes wear old clothes to
        see what people do.</p>

    <p>The millionaire takes Richard to the biggest shop in the area and says to&nbsp;
        him&nbsp; &ldquo;Choose anything you want, Even the most expensive one.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Richard chooses the newest stereo because next time , when his bird keeps silent he
        will listen&nbsp; to music with his friends.</p>
