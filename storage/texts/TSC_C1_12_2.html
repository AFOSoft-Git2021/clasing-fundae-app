		<b>Questions: TSC-C1_12_6 until C1_12_10</b>
	</h3>


	<p>Dear
		Ms. Flores,</p>

	<p>I
		work for Facilities Management here at Wurnster University.
	</p>
	<p>It
		was recently brought to my attention that they might have been
		scheduling wrong reservations.
	</p>

	<p>These
		things have been being dealt with seriously by the reservation
		department.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately,
		it has been reserved for every Wednesday this semester by the
		Wurnster Debate Club.
	</p>

	<p>You
		might have been left with a decision to change the room or dates.
	</p>

	<p>The
		email has been being written by our staff this morning.
	</p>

	<p>We
		apologize for this. The system might have been glitching all this
		time.
	</p>


	<p>You
		can visit the facilities management website in order to check the
		availability of other room locations and reschedule the talk.</p>

	<p>Hoping
		for your understanding,
	</p>

	<p>Jake
		Patterson</p>
