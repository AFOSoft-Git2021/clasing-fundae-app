	</h3>


	<p>
		Man:
		Hey,
		Katrina! You should be picked up by my brother at 5 o&rsquo;clock. I
		am still figuring out what to wear for this year&rsquo;s rock
		festival. I hope it&rsquo;s over the top with artists this year.</p>

	<p>
		Woman:
		Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been looking at Insta for outfits that may be worn
		at the festival. I hope we won&rsquo;t get that tipsy! We must have
		been crazy last year to pass out.
	</p>
	<p>
		However,
		are you sure if we leave at 5:00 we will still get there on time? It
		starts at 5:30 and I think it takes at least an hour to get there.</p>

	<p>
		Man:
		Totally! I might have passed out by the 3rd band. Isn&rsquo;t it
		being held in Harpersville like last year?</p>

	<p>
		Woman:
		No, the festival is being held in Bristol this year. The festival
		organizers are expecting the venue to be loaded this year. They might
		have taken into consideration enough parking space. So they moved it
		to Bristol.</p>
