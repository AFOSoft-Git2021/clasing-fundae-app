    <h1>Two Hotels</h1>

    <p>
      Angela: I&rsquo;ve found these two hotel brochures. Let&rsquo;s look at
      them closely for our holiday. The first one is the Alba Hotel. It&rsquo;s
      a nice small hotel near the city centre. The second one is the Conrad
      hotel by the seaside.
    </p>
    <p>Mike: Let&rsquo;s compare them, then.</p>
    <p>
      Angela: Alba is a boutique hotel and doesn&rsquo;t have many facilities.
      It&rsquo;s cheaper than the Conrad hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike: Yes, you&rsquo;re right. Besides, it&rsquo;s lovelier than the
      Conrad hotel. Look at this lovely restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Angela: On the other hand, the Conrad hotel is a five-star hotel and it
      has everything. There is even a hairdresser in it. I think it is more
      relaxing than the Alba hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike: I agree with you. However, Alba looks cosier than Conrad. It really
      has a warm atmosphere. Besides, I think Conrad is a bit expensive hotel.
    </p>
    <p>Angela: What about the rooms?</p>
    <p>Mike: Conrad&rsquo;s rooms are larger and nicer than Alba&rsquo;s.</p>
    <p>
      Angela: Alba&rsquo;s rooms are looking at the river, so their views can be
      more beautiful than Conrad&rsquo;s. However, their room service
      isn&rsquo;t as good as Conrad&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike: Alba is only five-story high. Conrad is much higher than Alba. I
      think a view from a Conrad&rsquo;s room will be great.
    </p>
    <p>
      Angela: Maybe. Both hotels have advantages and disadvantages. I
      can&rsquo;t decide on one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mike: Let&rsquo;s go to Conrad Hotel. It&rsquo;s bigger and has a great
      swimming pool. I think the weather will be hotter than now when we get
      there. This swimming pool will be awesome for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Angela: Alright, let&rsquo;s go to Conrad then. Also, their rooms look
      much cleaner than Alba&rsquo;s.
