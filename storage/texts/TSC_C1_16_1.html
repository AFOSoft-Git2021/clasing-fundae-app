	<p>Dear
		Mr. Rivers,</p>

	<p>I

		kitchen and shop. The kitchen is being renovated. The equipment is
		being replaced. Kitchen waste is being disposed of properly. The
		inventory is being restocked. The delivery is being received. The
		products are being delivered. The inspection is being taken care of.
		The power shortage is being dealt with. The interior of the kitchen
		is being designed by a professional.</p>

	<p>Regarding
		the recruitment, the candidates are being interviewed. New recruits
		are being trained. The new manager is being introduced to the team.
		Daily reports are being written. John is being promoted. The
		advertisement is being aired. Flyers are being handed off. The new
		teams are being assembled. The recent conflict is being handled. The
			appeal of a change in shifts is being considered.</p>
