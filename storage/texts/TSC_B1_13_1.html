      Ways Robots Could Transform Our Future
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Robots could improve our public security. They can predict and detect
          crimes faster.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Robots can be used in our education system as an introduction in
          computer-based learning. It&rsquo;s not replacing the teacher, but it
          enables students to learn at their own pace.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Home robots are already becoming part of our lives. We can set up the
          vacuum cleaner to do the chore for us. We can schedule a warm
          home-cooked meal to be ready by the time we&rsquo;re finished with
          work.&nbsp;
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Robots could take away some of our jobs. Whether we like it or not,
          robots have already replaced many people in their jobs. In the future,
          robots could take over half of low-skilled jobs.&nbsp;
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Even though robots could take away some of our jobs, they can create
          jobs, too. Artificial intelligence will most likely replace tasks, not
          jobs.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Autonomous cars can be seen more in the future.&nbsp;
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Pharmabotics will bring changes. Pharmabotics can interact, check and
          evaluate patients. They&#39;ll be like ATMs for medicines, so we can
          get the medications we need while avoiding the inconvenience of
          talking to a stranger about our health issues.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Robots for entertainment could be personalized, interactive, and
          engaging than ever. In the future, we can interact with our home
          entertainment systems through conversations.&nbsp;
      </li>
    </ul>

    <u>
      <li>
        Robots could boost our standard of living. With software automating
          systems, we can have a more comfortable future for
          ourselves.&nbsp;
      </li>
    </ul>
