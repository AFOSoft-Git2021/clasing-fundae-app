    <p><span>Teacher</span><span>: What have you guys learned from the discussion today?</span></p>
    <p><span>Zac:</span><span>&nbsp;I learned that &ldquo;obviously&rdquo; means in
            a way that is easy to understand or see.</span></p>
    <p><span>Ken:</span><span>&nbsp;I learned that &ldquo;surely&rdquo; is used to
            express surprise that something has happened or is going to happen.</span></p>
    <p><span>Will:</span><span>&nbsp;I learned that &ldquo;apparently&rdquo; is used
            to say you have read or been told something although you are not certain it is true.</span></p>
    <p><span>Mia:</span><span>&nbsp;I learned that &ldquo;undoubtedly&rdquo; is used
            to emphasize that something is true.</span></p>
    <p><span>Olivia:</span><span>&nbsp;I learned that &ldquo;possibly&rdquo; is
            used with &quot;can&quot; or &quot;could&quot; for emphasis.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Teacher:</span><span>&nbsp;Use the word &ldquo;obviously&rdquo; in a sentence.</span></p>
    <p><span>Zac:</span><span>&nbsp;We&#39;re obviously going to need more help.</span></p>
    <p><span>Ken:</span><span>&nbsp;The principal obviously agrees with you.</span></p>
    <p><span>Will:</span><span>&nbsp;She was obviously in distress after the attack.</span></p>
    <p><span>Mia:</span><span>&nbsp;He obviously hasn&#39;t profited by his experiences.</span></p>
    <p><span>Olivia:</span><span>&nbsp;He&#39;s obviously a man of very high intelligence.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Teacher:</span><span>&nbsp;Use the word &ldquo;apparently&rdquo; in a sentence.</span></p>
    <p><span>Zac:</span><span>&nbsp;He was apparently very surprised at the news.</span></p>
    <p><span>Ken:</span><span>&nbsp;The plane apparently overshot the runway after landing.</span></p>
    <p><span>Will:</span><span>&nbsp;Apparently, it&#39;s going to rain today.</span></p>
    <p><span>Mia:</span><span>&nbsp;Apparently, you have done a lot of work.</span></p>
    <p><span>Olivia:</span><span>&nbsp;Apparently, he&#39;s a sod to work
            for.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Teacher:</span><span>&nbsp;Use the word &ldquo;possibly&rdquo; in a
            sentence.</span></p>
    <p><span>Zac:</span><span>&nbsp;Could I possibly use the bathroom?</span></p>
    <p><span>Ken:</span><span>&nbsp;How can I possibly do it?</span></p>
    <p><span>Will:</span><span>&nbsp;We can&#39;t possibly get the work done by
            October.</span></p>
    <p><span>Mia:</span><span>&nbsp;I&#39;ll do all I possibly can.</span></p>
    <p><span>Olivia:</span><span>&nbsp;This is possibly their worst performance
            ever.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Teacher:</span><span>&nbsp;Great job, everyone! </span></p>
