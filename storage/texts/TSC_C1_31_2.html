	<p>
		Prosperous life; what is it and what makes it</span></b></i>
	</p>

	<p>
		The
		definition of success varies. For the wealthy, it might mean living
		in an affluent neighborhood. &quot;Wealth means success,&quot; says
		the rich man. For the poverty-stricken neighborhood, it might mean
		being able to eat three meals a day. Having a hot meal might mean
		success to a poor man.
	</p>

	<p>Life
		gives uncharitable fate. The big difference might make the
		impoverished hate the stinking rich. The needy lacks opportunity. The
		rich lack compassion. We lack time to take a look and see that we are
		all the same with our tight schedule.
	</p>

	<p>Wealth
		and material possessions are not the only ways to measure a
		prosperous life. Desires and ego make a man, as do love and
		compassion. Balance is necessary. Unselfishness makes a community
		prosper. Selfishness makes an individual prosper. Love and compassion
		make for an affluent world. Charitable acts can be born from
		uncharitable fate.
	</p>
