    <p><span">Dear diary,&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <p><span">I read an article not long ago. I found out that people lived in caves in ancient
            times. Humans were formerly hunters. </span><span>I saw a dead cat not long ago and I
            puked.</span><span">&nbsp;</span><span>I don&rsquo;t think I would&#39;ve survived in
            ancient times.</span></p>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <p><span>A king in ancient times had many slaves work for him. It must have been hard to live
            in ancient times.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <p><span>It happened a long time ago, but I&rsquo;m still curious about it. I love it when
            my parents talk about how they lived in the old days. It&rsquo;s cool to think about how a building was
            formerly an old structure.</span></p>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <p><span>Sincelery yours,</span></p>
    <p><span>Anna</span></p>
