    <h1>Alice and Martha</h1>

    <p>Martha: Hi, Alice.</p>

    <p>Alice: Hello, Martha.&nbsp;Do you live nearby?</p>

    <p>Martha: Yes, I live near the hospital. What about you?</p>

    <p>Alice: My house is along the shop of Mr. Peter.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Martha: Oh, I&rsquo;ve been to that shop once. I didn&rsquo;t know you
      lived near there.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Alice: What about you, which hospital is near your house?</p>

    <p>Martha: Hmm, It is the Hopkins hospital. It is behind the park.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Alice: Wow, that seems far from here. I would probably walk over the
      bridge to get to that hospital.
    </p>

    <p>
      Martha: I sometimes take that way but today I have to take this bus.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Alice: Alright, see you tomorrow in class.&nbsp;</p>
