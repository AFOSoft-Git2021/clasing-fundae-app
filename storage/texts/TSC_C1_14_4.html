		<b>Questions: TSC-C1_14_16 until C1_14_20</b>
	</h3>

	<p>
		Man:
		Hello. Out of the blue, I just wanted to ask about my air
		conditioner. I might have bought it from your store, but I might have
		forgotten to change the air filter. Should I replace it soon?</p>
	<p>

	<p>
		Woman:
		I am a newbie here, just give me a second while I check your
		information. Hmm, it says that you might have passed the date
		recommended to change your filter.
	</p>
	<p>
		If
		you suffer from allergies, you should change it even more often.</p>
	<p>

	<p>
		Man:
		Oh, that&rsquo;s bonkers. If I had known the exact duration, I would
		have done it differently.</p>
	<p>
		Well,
		How can I purchase a replacement? Do you carry it there?</p>
	<p>

	<p>
		Woman:
		Yes, we do. All you need to do is to look at the model number of your
		air conditioner, it must have been written at the back.
	</p>
	<p>
		Man:
		Sounds good! I hope my air conditioner won&rsquo;t be in a bad shape.

	</p>
