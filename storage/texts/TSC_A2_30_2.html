    <p>How to Teach Texture!</p>

    <p>Texture is fun to teach because students get to use their hands.</p>

    <p>That&rsquo;s right. The more they touch the surface of an object, the better they
        will understand what that big word &ndash; texture &ndash; means.</p>

    <p>Give them a variety of objects to touch. Maybe let them rub them, stroke them, and
        even squeeze them.</p>

    <p>As your learners touch the surface of different objects, they will notice that things
        don&rsquo;t all feel the same.</p>

    <p>Some things feel hard, other things feel soft or fluffy, and other things may feel
        slimy.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The main point is to get excited with them about all the new ways they can describe
        objects by the way that they feel.</p>
