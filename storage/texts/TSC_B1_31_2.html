    <p>Dear diary,</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I have been enjoying my stay at a resort. I have been eating tropical foods. I have been drinking freshly made juices.</p>
    <p>I have been visiting other tourist spots. There are a lot of wonderful spots near the resort where I stay. I have been seeing beautiful scenes.</p>
    <p>I have been making lots of unforgettable moments. I have been meeting up with locals. I have been making friends with the people I interact with.</p>
    <p>I have been watching surfers surf waves. I have been capturing every scene with my camera. It's a good thing I brought my camera with me. I've captured a lot and the storage isn't enough. I have been transferring the pictures from my camera to my laptop.</p>
    <p>I have been practicing breathing techniques. I have been reading educational books. I feel like I've been progressing as a person. I've also been meditating a lot recently. It has made me more relaxed.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>Luke.</p>
