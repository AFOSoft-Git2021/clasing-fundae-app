    <p>Ann&rsquo;s Wedding Plans</p>
    
    <p>Ann sat alone by her desk and happily imagined her upcoming wedding.</p>
    
    <p>She thought, &ldquo;I will have a big wedding! I will wear a beautiful, white
            dress.&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>I will walk down the center of the church and the dress will drag along behind
            me!&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;I will wear a diamond necklace and diamond earrings.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;I will wear high heeled shoes that will make me look tall.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;I will have professional makeup. I will look so beautiful, it will take my new
            husband&rsquo;s breath away!&nbsp;&ldquo;</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;Hmm ... how much will all of this cost?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;I will have my wedding in a big church, with pretty windows and a nice
            priest.</p>
    <p>Hmm ... how much will a church like that cost?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;We will have a big reception in a big hall. We will hire a cook. The food will
            be very tasty.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;We will serve lobster and sushi, with lots of drinks! We will have a very tall
            cake.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;Hmm ... how much will a reception like that cost?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;We will invite everyone we know. We will invite all of our friends from home
            and college.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;We will invite everyone from work and everyone from church! We will invite all
            of our aunts and uncles and cousins. We will invite all of their kids!&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;Hmm ... how much will that many people eat?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Suddenly, Ann&nbsp; thought,</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;On&nbsp; second&nbsp; thought,&nbsp; I&nbsp; think&nbsp; we&nbsp; will&nbsp;
            have&nbsp; a&nbsp; small wedding!&rdquo;</p>
