    <p>Lucy: Come over here Jane and have a look at this dress.</p>
    <p>Jane: Oh, yes! It looks lovely. I am loving the lace details in the front
        already.</p>

    <p>Lucy: I know! I think this dress goes with your silver heels.</p>
    <p>Jane: I actually think I should change my heels. This dress has a bit of brass flower
        details at the back.</p>

    <p>Lucy: Hmm. You are right. What about that silk gold skirt? I would like to try
        it.</p>

    <p>Jane: That will actually look good on you, Lucy!</p>
    <p>Lucy: I don&rsquo;t think I have gold heels. Do you think it will match my doll
        shoes? I have bronze copper heels.</p>

    <p>Jane: Just make sure you have a black top. Do you think we need a jacket for the
        event? I heard it will be cold.</p>
    <p>Lucy: I have a leather jacket at home. And you?</p>
    <p>Jane: I still have my old cotton jacket, the one you gifted me.</p>

    <p>Lucy: Right. But look there is a wool jacket on sale here.</p>
    <p>Jane: I don&rsquo;t really like the wool material of this. I am not a fan of velvet
        jackets. I prefer this cashmere jacket.</p>
