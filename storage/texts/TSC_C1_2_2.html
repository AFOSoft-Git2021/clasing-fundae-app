	<p>Dear
		Lucy,</p>
	<p><br />

	<p>I
		would like to tell you about the family that I met in Australia. The
		couple had three children and all of them were adults. Two of them
		were working during the day and they are really hard-working people.
	</p>
	<p><br />

	<p>Every
		breakfast I usually have a conversation with the wife. She's
		good-natured and I love to talk to her and she tells me how she
		became tight-fisted to manage the expenses of the family. She's
		kind-hearted to all, especially to her family. And the younger
		daughter she’s smooth-tongued and good-natured too. I learn a lot
		from her.
	</p>
	<p><br />

	<p>It's
		great that I’m practicing a lot of English but I can’t take it
		away that I’m absent-minded sometimes. Anyway, this is a great
		opportunity to be here and I'm broad-minded to know Australian
		culture.
	</p>
	<p><br />

	<p>I’ll
		get back to you soon, love and kisses!</p>
	<p>Michel</p>
