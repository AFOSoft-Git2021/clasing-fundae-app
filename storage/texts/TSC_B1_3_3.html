    <p>
      Stef:&nbsp;I was meaning to call you earlier, however, I feel that you
      don&rsquo;t want to talk to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fay:&nbsp;You are talking to me now otherwise, you won&rsquo;t be hearing
      anything from me.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Stef:&nbsp;I feel bad and I am sorry for what happened at the party.</p>

    <p>
      Fay:&nbsp;First of all, you could have said sorry at the party, but you
      didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Stef:&nbsp;I know.&nbsp;In order to calm myself, I had to distance myself
      first.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Fay:&nbsp;There were a lot of times you were alone, for instance, when you
      were sitting at the sofa, drinking.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Stef:&nbsp;I was alone but at the same time my mind was away.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Stef:&nbsp;I had to sit outside so that I could think clearly.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Fay:&nbsp;What you are saying is right but nevertheless your actions at
      the party were unacceptable.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Stef:&nbsp;The next time I distance myself, please be honest and talk to
      me.
