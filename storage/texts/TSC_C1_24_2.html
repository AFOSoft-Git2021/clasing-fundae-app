		<b>Questions: TSC-C1_24_11 until C1_24_20</b>
	</h3>


	<p>
		Steff:
		What? It&rsquo;s raining. I should have carried my umbrella.</p>
	<p>
		Andy:
		My shoes are going to get wet. We should have rescheduled this night
		out.
	</p>
	<p>
		Steff:
		Wait, I'll call my brother and ask him to come pick us up. He&rsquo;s
		not answering; I regretted what I did earlier, I shouldn't have
		shouted at him earlier.</p>
	<p>
		Andy:
		I shouldn&rsquo;t have forgotten that Mr. Logan told us it is about
		to rain.
	</p>
	<p>
		Steff:
		It&rsquo;s
		getting chilly. I should have worn a jacket.</p>
	<p>
		Andy:
		I&rsquo;m still worried about my shoes, these are new trainers. I
		shouldn't have worn this.</p>
	<p>
		Steff:
		It
		will be alright. My brother should have read the messages by now.</p>
	<p>
		Andy:
		I need to go to the restroom. I shouldn't have drunk so much.</p>
	<p>
		Steff:
		Jack has a car; I should have told him to come by at his apartment
		and come.
	</p>
	<p>
		Andy:
		We chose the wrong day to go out. We shouldn't have gone here.</p>
