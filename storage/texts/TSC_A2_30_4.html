    <p>&nbsp;What materials do architects use for texture?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      Tactile texture on the other hand could be given by building materials,
      such as concrete, brick, stone, glass, steel etc.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Smooth materials, such as glass, create a smooth and soft texture, whereas
      rough materials such as stone, brick or concrete, create a rough and hard
      texture.
