    <p>Barb: We have to re-examine
        the students&rsquo; papers.</p>

    <p>Leo: Why? Did we find a lot of mistakes?&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Barb: Yesterday, Arya&rsquo;s mother called. She
        can&rsquo;t believe her daughter&rsquo;s score.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Leo: I remember so well, we graded it
        accurately.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Barb: We have to get ready for this afternoon&rsquo;s
        meeting.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Leo: Are we doing the meeting at Professor
        Bailey&rsquo;s office?&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Barb: I don&rsquo;t think so. I heard it will be at
        Harris&#39;s office.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Leo: We better make a copy of Arya&rsquo;s test
        papers.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Barb: Not just hers but everyone&#39;s test
        papers.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Leo: Have you talked to Harris? What are Harris&#39;s
        views about the complaints?&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Barb: I haven&rsquo;t talked to her but I&rsquo;ll
        try to invite her at Izza&rsquo;s cafe before we have the meeting.&nbsp;</p>
