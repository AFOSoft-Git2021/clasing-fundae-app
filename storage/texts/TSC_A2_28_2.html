    <p>Clive and some of his daily activities at work.</p>

    <p>I go to work at 8.45am every
        morning.
    </p>
    <p>I usually drive to get to
        work.
    </p>
    <p>The first thing I do is to check my emails when I get to work, but I don&#39;t always
        reply to them
        immediately.
    </p>
    <p>I take a taxi or a train if I have a lunch meeting. I never take the bus because it
        is too
        slow.
    </p>
    <p>When I am at my desk I usually work on the computer, even during morning
        tea.
    </p>
    <p>I always have lunch at 1 pm.
    </p>

    <p>At 3pm we have afternoon tea, and that is when we usually talk and eat
        cake.
    </p>
    <p>When you are in the office you probably have a lot of papers.</p>

    <p>I always file my papers in the folder, so that I can find them again.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>When I work I have to make telephone calls. If an important issue happens I ask my
        secretary to organise a
        meeting.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Once a month I report to my boss, I usually write a document that my boss can
        read.
