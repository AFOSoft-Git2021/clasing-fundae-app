	<p>Dear
		diary,</p>

	<p>I
		learned a lot today. Bacteria are too small for the naked eye. Simple
		organisms like bacteria mutate rapidly. Bacteria reproduce by
		dividing and making copies of themselves. Bacteria will not breed in
		alcohol. Chlorine is added to water to kill bacteria.
	</p>

	<p>I
		also learned a lot about fungi. Phosphorescent fungi attract
		night-flying insects. Antibiotics are chemicals produced naturally by
		fungi to kill their rivals: bacteria. Soil bacteria and fungi live by
		digesting and recycling dead plant material such as leaves and seed
		cases. Mildew and mushrooms are fungi.</p>

	<p>Octopuses
		are interesting. Octopuses are very delicate animals that are
		sensitive to nitrogen and other waste products from fish. Octopuses
		are molluscs. Octopuses are found in every ocean in the world.
		Octopuses can survive outside the water for about 20â€“30 minutes.</p>

	<p>Yours.</p>
	<p>Mike.</p>
