		Shana Sandberg</p>
	<p>
		Date:
		Oct. 9</p>
	<p>
		Subject:
		Delivery Issues</p>

	<p>
		I
		am just checking in the order that I have to be received by this
		afternoon.
	</p>

	<p>
		But
		in my application, it is to be handed down to me by tomorrow.
	</p>

	<p>
		The
		Avalanche stove is something that I expect to be used for tomorrow’s
		party.
	</p>

	<p>
		Can
		I request for the courier to have mine to be delivered as soon as
		possible today?
	</p>

	<p>
		If
		there are certain charges to be added, please let me know.
	</p>

	<p>
		I’ll
		be waiting.</p>
	<p>
		Thank
		you,</p>
	<p>

		Sandberg</p>
