    <p>Rectangle</p>
    <p>
      A quadrilateral has two pairs of opposite sides equal in length and
      interior angles are at the right angles.
    </p>

    <p>Parallelogram</p>
    <p>
      A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides and
      opposite angles are equal in measure.
    </p>

    <p>Polygons</p>
    <p>
      These are made up of line segments and no curves. They are enclosed
      structures based on different lengths of sides and different angles.

    <p>In three dimensions, the primary shapes are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cube</li>
      <li>Cuboid</li>
      <li>Cone</li>
      <li>Cylinder</li>
      <li>Sphere</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      A cube&nbsp;is a three-dimensional shape which has 6 faces, 8 vertices and
      12 edges. The faces of the cube are square.
    </p>
    <p>Example: A Rubik&rsquo;s cube</p>
    <p>
      A cuboid&nbsp;is also three dimensional solid having 6 faces, 8 vertices
      and 12 edges but the faces of the cuboid are in a rectangular shape.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>Example: Matchbox</p>

    <p>
      A cone&nbsp;is a solid which has a circular base and narrows smoothly from
      the surface to the top at a point called apex or vertex.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>Example: An ice-cream cone</p>
