		Man:

		Hi, Tiffany. Do you know what happened to the company car? I tried to

		night?

	</p>

	<p>

		Woman:

		Well, the car has been broken by Mark. It got a flat tire.

	</p>
	<p>

		The
		damage has been being handled by Mark since last night.

	</p>
	<p>

		Till
		now, They have been fixing the car&rsquo;s damage. I'll let you know
		when they call me.

	</p>

	<p>

		Man:

		Oh, that&rsquo;s good news. Another car is what I have been planning
		to call to pick up a client from the airport.

	</p>

	<p>

		Woman:
		Ah, isn&rsquo;t that Mr. Lee from Beijing? You have been dealing with
		an important person.

	</p>
	<p>
		Just
