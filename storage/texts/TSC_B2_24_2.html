    <p>Dear diary,&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      I woke up early this morning. My mom made breakfast. It was sausages and
      pancakes. I ate lots of pancakes.
    </p>

    <p>
      After eating, I went out for a walk. After my walk, I picked up my dog at
      home. My dog&rsquo;s name is Rodulf.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      We went to the park. I played fetch with my dog. He chased the sticks that
      I threw.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rodulf and I ate lunch at a cafe. I bought dog food for Rodulf at a
      convenience store on our way to the cafe. I ate pasta for lunch. Rodulf
      enjoyed his beef-flavored dog food.
    </p>

    <p>
      We went back home after lunch. My mom bought fried chicken for dinner.
      It&rsquo;s my favorite food.
    </p>

    <p>
      I&rsquo;ll sleep early today. I will help my mom with the groceries
      tomorrow.
    </p>

    <p>ours,</p>
    <p>Rose</p>
