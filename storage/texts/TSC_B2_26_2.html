    <p>Dear diary,</p>

    <p>
      My friend taught me how to ride a motorcycle. I want to buy my own
      motorcycle. My friend bought his motorcycle at a junk shop. It took him a
      lot of time to repair his motorcycle.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want to save money. I want to borrow money but I have to pay
      interest.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      I&rsquo;ll ask my friends if they want to buy some of my art works. I
      might draw portraits of them if they want to. I&rsquo;ll bring my art
      supplies to school.
    </p>

    <p>
      I never got a chance to drive my dad&rsquo;s motorcycle. I might ask him
      if I could borrow his motorcycle.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      My grandfather gave my dad his motorcycle. If ever my dad lets me drive
      it, I&rsquo;ll take good care of it. I&rsquo;ll go grab him a drink and
      ask him right now.
    </p>

    <p>Good night,</p>
    <p>Henry</p>
