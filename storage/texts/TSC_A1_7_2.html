    <h1>Julia&acute;s routine</h1>

    <p>
      My name&#39;s Julia, and I am 27 years old. I live in London but I&rsquo;m
      German. I live with my boyfriend and we are very happy. I work in a bank
      and I love my job.

      On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday I go to the gym after work. &nbsp;When I
      get home, I have a shower again, I prepare dinner and I watch TV for a
      while. I like to go to bed as soon as possible, around 9:30.
    </p>

    <p>
      From Monday to Friday, my day starts very early. I always get up at 6:30
      and I have a 20-minute shower. Then, I get dressed and comb my hair. At
      07:00 a.m I have breakfast, &nbsp;I usually have coffee and cereal. After
      that, I put on my make up and go to work.

      At 10:00 a.m., I sometimes have a snack and at 12:00 I usually have lunch
      at the office with my colleagues. They are wonderful people who have a
      good sense of humor, and they are good friends too. At 3:30 I have a snack
      again, I usually have some tea and biscuits.

      Thursday is different because I don&#39;t go to the gym. I go out with my
      boyfriend every Thursday. We sometimes go to the cinema or we go out for
      dinner and to the cinema.
