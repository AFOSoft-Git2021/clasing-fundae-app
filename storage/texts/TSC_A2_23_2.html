    <p>Girl: Dad, I need a few school supplies, and I was wondering if . . . .</p>
    <p>Dad: Yeah. There are a couple of pencils and an eraser in the kitchen drawer, I
            think.</p>
    <p>Girl: Dad, I&rsquo;m in eight grade now, and I need REAL supplies for my demanding
            classes.</p>
    <p>Dad: Oh, so you need a ruler too?</p>
    <p>Girl: Dad, I need some high-tech school supplies like a calculator and a laptop for
            my Math subject.</p>
    
    <p>Dad: Uh. I didn&rsquo;t have any of that when I was in middle school.</p>
    <p>Girl: I need the laptop tomorrow for our lesson.</p>
    <p>Dad: You can borrow my laptop.</p>
    
    <p>Girl: I also need highlighters, so I can easily remember the lesson.</p>
    <p>Dad: What about flashcards? That will be helpful too.</p>
    <p>Girl: You are right, Dad. I will check the email of my English teacher in case I
            forgot something.</p>
    <p>Girl: Dad, We also need to buy some chalk. I need to write something on the board.
            Before I forget, a red pen is also on the list.</p>
