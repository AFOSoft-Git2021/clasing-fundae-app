    <p>Anya - Kyle, use these scissors to cut these magazines then file with paper
        clips.</p>

    <p>Kyle- I will, thank you. Can you find my lunch box inside my backpack?
    </p>

    <p>Anya- Sure. Where is your backpack?</p>
    <p>Kyle- You will find it on top of my desk.</p>

    <p>Anya- I found it! I really think you have a cool notebook.</p>

    <p>Kyle- Thanks. Do you need pencils? I have a lot of them.</p>

    <p>Anya- Yes, I need some of it. Do you also have a ruler? I need to measure
        something.</p>

    <p>Kyle- What are you going to measure?</p>

    <p>Anya- I need to measure a box for our homework.</p>

    <p>Kyle- Oh yes, I need to do that! I should buy some glue too.</p>
