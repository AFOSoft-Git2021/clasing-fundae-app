      Sam wants to play Game of Kings, but Jack is more interested in Sam&#39;s
      family.
    </h1>
    <p>Jack: Hi Sam. How&rsquo;s it going?</p>
    <p>Sam: Good. How are you?</p>
    <p>Jack: Fine, thanks. Hey, is that the new version of Game of Kings?</p>
    <p>Sam: Yeah, do you want to play? It&rsquo;s great!</p>
    <p>Jack: Oh! You can&rsquo;t buy that here! Where did you get it?</p>
    <p>Sam: From my brother. He sent it to me.</p>
    <p>Jack: What? Charlie?</p>
    <p>
      Sam: No, my other brother, Rob. He lives in the States ... in New York.
    </p>
    <p>Jack: Really? I didn&rsquo;t know you had another brother!</p>
    <p>Sam: Yeah! Well, he&rsquo;s my half-brother.</p>
    <p>Jack: But ... I don&rsquo;t get it ...</p>
    <p>
      Sam: He&rsquo;s my dad&rsquo;s son. My dad went to New York to study and
      married an American.
    </p>
    <p>Jack: Your mum&rsquo;s American?!</p>
    <p>Sam: No, no, not my mum. That was ages ago ... before he met my mum.</p>
    <p>
      Jack: Ah, OK, I get it now. Wow, I didn&rsquo;t know that! So, how old is
      your half-brother?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam: Er, he&rsquo;s five years older than me, so he&rsquo;s twenty-three.
    </p>
    <p>Jack: Cool. And do you see him often?</p>
    <p>
      Sam: Not very often ... I&rsquo;ve been to visit him twice. Well, three
      times, but the first time I don&rsquo;t remember because I was really
      little. But we speak on Skype a lot.
    </p>
    <p>Jack: And have you met Rob&rsquo;s mum?</p>
    <p>
      Sam: Yeah. She&rsquo;s really nice. She&rsquo;s from Mexico originally.
      She&rsquo;s married to someone else now.
    </p>
    <p>Jack: And what does your mum think?</p>
    <p>
      Sam: Er ... She&#39;s fine about it! She knew my dad was divorced and had
      a son.
    </p>
    <p>Jack: Huh ... OK.</p>
