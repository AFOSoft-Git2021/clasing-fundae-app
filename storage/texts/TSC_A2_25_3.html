    <p>Dave: What do you do on your regular commute? Do you listen to something?</p>
    <p>Sky: Whenever I take the subways, I listen to English podcasts, and you?
    </p>
    <p>Dave: I don&rsquo;t miss the news when I ride the bus, I make sure I listen to
        it.</p>
    <p>Sky: Which types of transportation make you feel sick?</p>
    <p>Dave: Airplanes make me sick. Whenever it takes off, I need to watch
        something.</p>
    <p>Sky: Well, riding the yacht makes me sick. It&rsquo;s the motion of the ocean you
        know.</p>
    <p>Dave: What is the most environmentally friendly form of transportation that you
        use?</p>
    <p>Sky: As of the moment, I would say my bicycle is environmentally
        friendly.</p>
    <p>I use a bicycle whenever I go grocery shopping. What about you, Dave?</p>
    <p>Dave: I always use my skateboard whenever I need to go somewhere nearby. Plus, it is
        a good exercise too.</p>
    <p>Dave: What&rsquo;s the best public transportation for you?</p>
    <p>Sky: For me, I will always say the best public transpo is the bus. I just think it is
        the easiest to find. Oh Dave, How often do you take a taxi?</p>
    <p>Dave: Well, I often take the taxi when I am not in a hurry. Speaking of what you
        asked me earlier, Do you regularly fly places?</p>
    <p>Sky: Hmm. Not really. But, I like to take the plane whenever I have long journeys.
        Additionally, I am in love with the view. This is a funny question, Can you sleep on transportation?
    </p>
    <p>Dave: Yeah! I don&rsquo;t mind sleeping on it. I sleep whenever I take the
        subways.</p>
