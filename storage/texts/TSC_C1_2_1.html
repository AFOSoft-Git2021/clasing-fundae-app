	<p><b>What
			kind of Personality do you look for in a good employee?</b></p>

	<p>Mark:Hi
		Jena, since you are working in the recruitment industry do you look
		for an employee who has good-natured characteristics?</p>

	<p>Jena:
		Well Mark, you see that all
		of the applicants will show off their best during the interview. You
		will encounter a lot of information in their profiles and you will
		notice that all of them are hard-working, good-natured and
		broad-minded etc.
	</p>

	<p>Mark:Who
		was the best employee you had ever hired?</p>
	<p>Jena:Hmmm,
		the best employee I have hired is Polo. He is the best employee in
		the company, he is hard-working and broad-minded whenever he talks to
		his bosses.</p>

	<p>Mark:
		And who was the terrible employee you had ever hired?</p>
	<p>Jena:Well,
		we had Cory for a longtime she is quick-tempered when it comes to
		complicated situations and sometimes she is narrow-minded to her
		bosses. But she's quick-witted, that's why she stays in the company
		for so long.</p>

	<p>
		Mark:
		Well, how was your Bosses?</p>
	<p>
		Jena:They
		are quite actually broad-minded, and they are really smooth-tongued.
		That's the reason why I love my bosses. How about you mark what kind
		of personality you have?</p>

	<p>Mark:Well
		Jena, it's hard to tell. But I’m good-natured in meeting new people
		and i'm very kind-hearted to all.</p>
	<p>
		Jena:Oh!
		It was interesting of you.</p>
	<p>Mark:
		Yeah. it is….</p>
