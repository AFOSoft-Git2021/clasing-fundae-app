    <h3 class="ReferenciaInterna">Questions: TSC-B1_18_1 until B1_18_15</h3>
    
    <p>Professor: If you could go back in time to change a
            decision you have made, what would you change?</p>
    
    <p>Ava: I used to work a lot and not spend time with
            my family. I could have spent more time with them.</p>
    
    <p>Leo: I was too scared to stand up when people made fun
            of me at school. I should have said or fought back to bullies.</p>
    
    <p>Zoe: I should have stayed in
            touch with some friends from childhood. It&#39;s good to remember all the fun we used to have.
    </p>
    
    <p>Eli: Romance is a big regret for me. If I could go
            back, I would have said what I truly felt to him.</p>
    
    <p>Eva: I used to worry about
            what others thought about me. I should have imagined that people&rsquo;s opinion won&rsquo;t matter in the
            future.</p>
    
    <p>Ivy: I always ask myself, why am I not confident enough?
            I wish I could have been more self-confident.</p>
    
    <p>Kai: I used to live the life my parents wanted for me.
            I always wanted to make them happy. I must have made a mistake not following what I wanted to
            do.</p>
    
    <p>Max: I always wanted my &lsquo;dream job&rsquo; but
            as I grew older, I always felt scared of following it. I should have believed more in
            myself.</p>
    
    <p>Luke: I didn&#39;t know how to have fun before. I
            used to be so serious about life. I could have gone to the bar, but I overthink a lot.</p>
    
    <p>Aries:Something I wish I could have done more trips
            by myself. It is good to have some alone time.</p>
    
    <p>Luna: I should have made peace with my family members I
            had issues with. I&rsquo;ve realized peace of mind is important.</p>
    
    <p>Mac: I must have made a lot of wrong decisions in not
            following the voice inside me. Try to trust your guts.</p>
    
    <p>Josh: I&rsquo;ve done a lot of stupid things because of
            hanging out with the wrong group. I should have listened to my parents.</p>
    
    <p>Matt: Now that I am working, I wish I could have
            finished getting my degree.</p>
    
    <p>Ace:Definitely, I regret not taking my health
            seriously. I should not have tried smoking in the first place. </p>
