      Haley:&nbsp;Bea! Look out for the road. might get run over by a car if
      you&rsquo;re not wary of your surroundings.

    <p>
      : I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m so burned out from work that I&rsquo;m not
      aware of what&rsquo;s happening around me anymore. I don&rsquo;t want to
      pass away, I still have a lot of work to do. Thanks for having my back.
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;No worries, I&rsquo;m just trying to look out for you. Ice cream can
      cheer up a tired spirit. Let&rsquo;s go get some, it&rsquo;s on me so
      don&rsquo;t worry about it.
    </p>

      Bea:&nbsp;Wow! Thank you so much. I&rsquo;ll pay back the favor when I get
      my salary.
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;It&rsquo;s okay. Just look out for cars next time. I don&rsquo;t
      want you to pass away. It may not seem like it, but you bring in good
      energy. I&rsquo;m thankful to have you as my friend.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bea:&nbsp;I&rsquo;m also grateful to have you. always inspire me to get
      back up. Whenever I feel down, I can&#39;t help but think back to when you
      comforted me.
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;Everyone falls down sometimes. I&rsquo;ll always be here to look out
      for you. don&rsquo;t have to pay back anything.
    </p>
