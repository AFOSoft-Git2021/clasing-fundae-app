    <p>Lili:&nbsp;It&#39;s likely to rain soon.</p>

    <p>Ann: Then, we will probably just play tennis tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Lili:&nbsp;But, I don&rsquo;t think I can. I&rsquo;m likely to go to see
      my dentist tomorrow.
    </p>

    <p>Ann: Can&rsquo;t you schedule it the next day?</p>

    <p>Lili: The clinic will probably be closed tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Ann: Too bad. The other school will likely come to play with us.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Lili: That&rsquo;s alright, I will probably not take a lot of time in the
      clinic.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Ann: You better me.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Lili: I am likely to come at noon.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Ann: Alright, I will probably call you when I am on the way.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Lili: Can you remind me to bring an extra shirt, I am likely to
      forget.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Ann: Yes, I will. I will probably bring an extra racket too.&nbsp;</p>
