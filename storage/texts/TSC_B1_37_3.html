    <p><strong>William:</strong> My brother injured himself while he was playing outside.</p>
    <p><strong>Leo:</strong> What's his injury?</p>
    <p><strong>William:</strong> I just got the result from the x-ray. He broke two bones. He needs to undergo surgery.</p>
    <p><strong>Leo:</strong> Damn. The operation will cost a lot.</p>
    <p><strong>William:</strong> Yeah. I have to go buy medicine for the inflammation.</p>
    <p><strong>Leo:</strong> I want to see the prescription.</p>
    <p><strong>William:</strong> He will also undergo various treatments after the surgery.</p>
    <p><strong>Leo:</strong> Looking at the x-ray makes me want to vomit. I hope your brother recovers well from this.</p>
    <p><strong>William:</strong> Thank you!</p>
