	<p> Woman: Are you guys ready? We need to leave shortly because the show starts in an hour. I can
		definitely smell a rat, I think the road will be very busy.</p>

	<p> Man: Don’t worry about it. Just turn a blind eye on the road and enjoy.
	</p>


	<p> I’m so excited! I’ve never seen a Broadway show before. I’ll call John, Mr. know-it-all, I hope he is
		ready to go. </p>

	<p> Woman: Tell him I can pick him up with my car on the way there, otherwise he has to take the subway
		and that will take a long time. </p>


	<p> If I were him, I'd gain the upper hand of being picked up by my car.
	</p>

	<p> Man: I will just call him now and let him know. </p>


	<p> Oh, Judy, I will give you some money for parking, I have a gut feeling it is going to be
		expensive. </p>
