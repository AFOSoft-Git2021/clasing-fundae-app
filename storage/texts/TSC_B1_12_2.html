    <p>Emily:&nbsp;Hi, Jane. Are you busy?</p>

    <p>Jane:&nbsp;No, I am not.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Emily:&nbsp;Did you talk to Ana? Did she tell you anything?&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Jane:&nbsp;Uhm.. I don&rsquo;t know if I should say this but Ana is a bit
      upset about what you said yesterday.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Emily:&nbsp;I just told her to hang out with us more often.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Jane:&nbsp;Didn&#39;t she tell you, She told me she is a bit busy with her
      family&rsquo;s problems.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Emily:&nbsp;I wish she could have told me when I met her last week.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Jane:&nbsp;You know Ana, she&rsquo;s not the type to say these things. She
      gets shy talking about her family.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Emily:&nbsp;We are friends, it is always good to tell someone if you need
      help.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Jane:&nbsp;Just call Ana now and say something nice. Don&rsquo;t forget to
      tell her you are sorry.
    </p>

    <p>Emily:&nbsp;Please, say some words too.</p>
