		The stingy funding meant that some middle-class people wouldn't get
		much financial help, despite high premiums.</p>

	<p>Harper:
		The article attempts to explain why we have in recent years become so
		ungenerous to migrants and refugees.</p>

	<p>Chris:
		Money is not the root of all evils as is usually claimed, what is the
		root of all evils is the lust for money, that is the excessive,
		selfish and greedy pursuit of money.</p>

	<p>Yoshi:
		We delude ourselves into thinking we are good, moral, unselfish
		people, but we are lying to ourselves for the benefit of others.</p>

		During the global economic crisis many people were left destitute.</p>

	<p>Ruiji:
		Poverty and destitution are widespread in the country.</p>

	<p>Stephen:
		Some beggars are neither
		poverty-stricken nor homeless.</p>

	<p>John:
		The complex was intended to be a modern, vibrant community to replace
		the old poverty-stricken neighborhoods of the poor.</p>
	<p>Adrian:
		Poverty rates rose near new train stations, not because the stations
		impoverished local residents, but because public transit was
		attracting the poor.</p>

	<p>Stephanie:
		Some of the merchants say
		they are unable to cut their expenses and are on the verge of going
		broke.</p>

	<p>Anthony:
		It was just after Christmas when everyone was totally skint.</p>
	<p>Joseph:
		It is not only pensioners
		in villages who are hard up.</p>

	<p>Kyle:
		It grieved me to see the poor man in such distress.</p>

	<p>Mary:
		Three hard-up governments are preparing to sell shares in state-owned
		assets in the next two weeks.</p>

	<p>Ann:
		Another example of modern
		capitalism securing a redistribution of wealth from the not very well
		off to the stinking rich.</p>
