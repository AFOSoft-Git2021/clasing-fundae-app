    <p><span>Arya:</span><span>&nbsp;I found this book a long time ago. In the old
            days, they used to sell books like this for a cheap price.</span></p>
    <p><span>Ken:</span><span>&nbsp;Where did you find that book, Grandma?</span></p>
    <p><span>Arya</span><span>: The school you go to was formerly a library. I bought
            it there. I met your grandpa there a long time ago.</span></p>
    <p><span>Ken:</span><span>&nbsp;What&rsquo;s Grandpa like?</span></p>
    <p><span>Arya:</span><span>&nbsp;Your grandpa was formerly a librarian. In the old
            days, he would let me borrow lots of books. In former times, parts of my heart were captured by his
            kindness.</span></p>
    <p><span>Ken:</span><span>&nbsp;I wish I had been born a long time ago.</span></p>

            gadgets in the old days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>Ken:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>I guess I just have to
