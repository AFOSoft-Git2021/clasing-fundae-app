    <p>Ethan: Which of these rackets is yours?</p>

    <p>Elsa: The red one is mine. Your racket is better than
        mine.</p>

    <p>Ethan:I think yours is pretty cool too. Mine was gifted
        by my mom.</p>

    <p>Elsa: Oh wow, you can see the details of it. I think
        it&rsquo;s expensive.</p>

    <p>Ethan: A cousin of mine works at a sports shop, my mom
        probably bought from him.</p>

    <p>Elsa:Really? That&rsquo;s super cool. I think a
        neighbor of ours works there too.</p>

    <p>Ethan:You should eat some food before we play.
    </p>

    <p>Elsa:Is this food ours? I thought it&rsquo;s the other
        team&#39;s food.</p>

    <p>Ethan:Yes, my mom packed this for us. This food is ours
        not theirs.</p>

    <p>Elsa: I am starving. My dad packed some food too, you
        should try mine.</p>
