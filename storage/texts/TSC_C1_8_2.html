	<p>Dear
		diary,</p>

	<p>I
		seem to have annoyed my friend. It was a mistake to have teased him
		nonstop. I seem to have pushed his buttons. I was sorry to have
		crossed the line. I would have liked to have read the situation
		better.
	</p>

	<p>My
		friend may have noticed my frustration. He
		pretended not to have felt upset. If I had known he was coming, I
		would have cleaned my room. He couldn&rsquo;t pretend anymore. He was
		sorry to have reacted badly. I&rsquo;m glad to have found a great
		friend.</p>

	<p>I
		seem to have broken my dad&rsquo;s motor. My dad may have noticed the
		scratches on his bike. He pretended not to have felt angry. It was a
		mistake to have ridden it on the broken road. I hope to have finished
		the repair by next week.
	
	<p>Yours,</p>

	<p>John.</p>
