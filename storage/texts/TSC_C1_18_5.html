	<p>To:All
		Staff</p>
	<p>From:Elizabeth
		Paine</p>
	<p>Date:January
		24</p>
	<p>Subject:Sick
		Leave</p>

	<p>Attention
		employees,</p>

	<p>Unfortunately,
		We are going to make adjustments to our policies concerning sick
		leave here at Zimnet Corporation.
	</p>

	<p>We
		are presumably reducing the number of paid vacation days and instead
		increasing the number of paid sick days available to employees.
	</p>

	<p>Before
		we make any changes, we obviously like to gather the opinions of
		employees on this matter.
	</p>

	<p>Please
		email Tony Nugent at tonynugent@zimnet.com.
	</p>

	<p>He
		will be collecting and analyzing your responses. Certainly,
		Management will produce a corresponding policy proposal by February
		24.
	</p>

	<p>Apparently,
		Once the proposal has been made, a meeting will be called to discuss
		its implementation among all of our employees.
	</p>
	<p>I
		hope this process can be helpful to all of our employees, and please
		be active in your participation.</p>

	<p>Sincerely,</p>
	<p>Elizabeth
		Paine</p>
