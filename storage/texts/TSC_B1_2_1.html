      Nina:&nbsp;So you remember I was reading the paper earlier when I was
      waiting for you on the street?
    </p>

    <p>Oliver:&nbsp;Yes, You were waiting at Place des Arts metro.</p>

    <p>
      Nina:&nbsp;Yeah, well there&rsquo;s an interesting article on the front
      page of the paper about political corruption.
    </p>

    <p>Oliver:&nbsp;Where, at the bottom of the page?</p>

    <p>
      Nina:&nbsp;Yes, You can find the article at the bottom of the paper in the
      left-hand corner.
    </p>

    <p>
      Oliver:&nbsp;I remember hearing something on the radio about this story.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nina:&nbsp;It&rsquo;s amazing. Look in the second paragraph, it&rsquo;s a
      huge scandal. And you will see the guy in the photograph, he looks guilty!
    </p>

      Sebastian:&nbsp;Hi guys, sorry I&rsquo;m late, I was waiting for a bus at
      the corner of Park avenue and the bus took ages. I don&rsquo;t understand
      why it took so long&hellip;
    </p>

    <p>
      Oliver:&nbsp;Oh yeah? So being late has nothing to do with the party you
      were at last night?
    </p>

    <p>
      Nina:&nbsp;That&rsquo;s alright. I heard there&rsquo;s an accident at the
      end of the road, maybe that&rsquo;s why the bus was late.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Sebastian:&nbsp;Is that so? I should have taken a taxi and waited at the
      bus stop then I think I won&rsquo;t be late.&nbsp;
