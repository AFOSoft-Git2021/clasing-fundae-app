    <p>After that I will make breakfast for my family. I shall cook lunch to bring to
        school.</p>

    <p>I will wait for the bus in front of our house.</p>

    <p>As soon as I finish school, I shall do all my homeworks before dinner time. I will
        ask my mom to help me with my homeworks.</p>
