    <p>Dear Diary,</p>

    <p>It is going to be a busy week or month for me.</p>

    <p>First, my family and I are leaving for Brazil next week.</p>

    <p>I will finally see my friends next Tuesday. We have a trip to the zoo on Wednesday
        morning at 9.</p>

    <p>I want to check some shops in Brazil, so I made an appointment with my Sales
        Assistant next Sunday.</p>

    <p>We are going to have a lot of fun. I will start packing my things this
        evening.</p>

    <p>We are leaving tomorrow so early because the plane leaves at 12 noon.
    </p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ll be writing back again,</p>

    <p>Luisa </p>
