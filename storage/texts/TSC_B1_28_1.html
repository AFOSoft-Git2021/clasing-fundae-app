    <p>Dear Diary,</p>
   
    <p>A lot of things will happen these upcoming days.</p>
   
    <p>The first thing is if I don&rsquo;t study well for this exam, I will fail. I am
            trying my best to listen and write down notes in class.</p>
   
    <p>But if Sally, who is my friend, sits beside me in class, I won&rsquo;t listen to the
            teacher.</p>
   
    <p>If I pass this exam, my dad will buy me the latest playstation.</p>
   
    <p>I love playing games. But if I play computer games all night, I&rsquo;ll be tired
            tomorrow.</p>
   
    <p>My mom said if I play games all night, I am going to be sick. I think she&rsquo;s
            right.</p>
    
    <p>I hope the weather today doesn&rsquo;t change this weekend. If it rains, I won&rsquo;t go to the baseball game.</p>
   
    <p>If I don&rsquo;t go to the game, my friend Matt will be very upset.</p>
   
    <p>I really need to sleep early. I don&rsquo;t want to hear my sister tomorrow
            &ldquo;You&#39;ll be late for school if you don&#39;t get up now.&rdquo; It can be very
            annoying.</p>
   
    <p>I wonder how much money I&rsquo;ve saved so far. If I have enough money, I&#39;ll buy
            some new shoes. I want to wear it for the baseball game.</p>
   
    <p>If I see Matt tomorrow, I will show him the shoes I like.</p>
   
    <p>Good night!</p>
