    <p><span>Justin:</span><span>&nbsp;Hey, try this new pizza I made. The previous
            ones still taste better. It doesn&rsquo;t taste better, but even so, it still tastes good.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Ray:</span><span>&nbsp;Hmm. This tastes better for me, regardless of the
            new flavour. This one has all the same ingredients but tastes better.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Justin:</span><span>&nbsp;I feel it&#39;s still lacking something. I took
            my time preparing the ingredients, but even so, I feel I left something out.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Ray:</span><span>&nbsp;It turned out well, regardless of how you handled
            it. All the same, there is some truth in what you said.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Justin:</span><span>&nbsp;Even so, I&rsquo;m still learning. There is
            still a lot of knowledge to uncover.</span></p>
