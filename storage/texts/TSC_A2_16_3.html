    <h1>All for Julie, the prettiest girl</h1>

    <p>
      In a town called Moreton lived three friends called John, Harry and
      Graham. One winter, a girl called Julie moved into the little cottage at
      the end of their street. They thought she was the prettiest girl in the
      whole world. From that day, everything they did was just to impress Julie.
      First they tried to impress her with poems.
    </p>
    <p>
      John wrote a long poem, Harry wrote a longer poem, and Graham wrote the
      longest poem in the whole world. Then they tried music. John played a loud
      guitar, Harry played a louder trumpet, and Graham played the loudest drum
      in the whole world. Then they decided to show off their engineering
      skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      John made a fast go kart, Harry made a faster go kart, and Graham made the
      fastest go kart in the whole world. Finally, they thought she&rsquo;s
      definitely be impressed by circus skills. John juggled something
      dangerous, Harry juggled something more dangerous, and Graham invented the
      most dangerous juggling trick ever. The next day was Julie&rsquo;s
      birthday party.
    </p>
    <p>
      So John bought a big present, Harry bought a bigger present, and Graham
      bought the biggest present in the whole world, and they all arrived nice
      and early and ready to impress, but Julie&rsquo;s garden was small, her
      cottage was smaller, and her door was the smallest on the street, so there
      was no space for huge presents, for juggling, for go karts, or for
      guitars, trumpets and drums. There was room for poems, but not for poems
      as long as John&rsquo;s, Harry&rsquo;s and Graham&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they took everything back home, went into Julie&rsquo;s house with
      nothing and had to have a tea party with Julie&rsquo;s little tea set, eat
      Julie&rsquo;s little cakes, play music on a little toy piano, and make
      new, smaller presents with origami.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they had the most fun all year, and when they left they were the
      happiest ever, and John, Harry and Graham were the best of friends.
