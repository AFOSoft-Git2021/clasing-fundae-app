    <p>It was a Friday afternoon when my brother and I thought of baking
        something.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Justin baked bread with most wheat in it.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>He asked me to make some cupcakes.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We only have a few of my ingredients in the fridge.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>But, I think we have enough eggs for my cupcakes.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We definitely don&rsquo;t have much sugar.</p>

    <p>The first thing I did was put half of the butter in a bowl.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A little bit of sugar and add eggs.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A single drop of vanilla to add some flavour. <br>I put half of the mixture in the
        cupcake cases.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I had to bake it for 20 minutes, I think I made lots of cupcakes
        today.&nbsp;</p>
