	<p>
		font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Dear
		AFC Members,</p>
	<p>
		font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This
		quarterly conference is something to be added as another monumental
		success.
	</p>
	<p>
		font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
		thank all of you for participating and sharing your expertise with
		others.
	</p>

	<p>
		font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
		hope all the skills you have learned are to be shared with others.
	</p>
	<p>
		font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Also,
		skills are to be applied in the offices and workplaces.
	</p>

	<p>
		font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Additionally,
		I encourage all of you to consider giving a presentation at the next
		conference.
	</p>
	<p>
		font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">I
		would also like to inform you of the invitation made by Kenneth
		Schneider, who will be giving a talk entitled &ldquo;Gaining
		confidence through leadership&rdquo; in his workplace next month.
	</p>
	<p>
		font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This
		incoming talk is to be watched in public for free. For more
		information, please see the attached file.</p>
	<p>
		font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Finally,
		it came to my attention that some members were not able to attend the
		conference due to scheduling conflicts.
	</p>
	<p>
		font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Therefore,
		from now on all conferences are going to be recorded and uploaded on
		our website so that distant members can watch and listen.</p>
	<p>
		font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Sincerely,</p>
	<p>
		font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Kelly
		O&rsquo;Neill,</p>
	<p>
		font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">President</p>
