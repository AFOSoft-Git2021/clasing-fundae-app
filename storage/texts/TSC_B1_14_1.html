    <p>
      We are Amanda and Amy, we are twins and best friends. We love to go
      swimming and do other outdoor activities.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      We may even go to the beach next week. &ldquo;The weather is supposed to
      be amazing, Amy said.&rdquo;&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Amanda shook her head and said &ldquo;Amy, the weather can change and we
      might not be able to go after all.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      She pointed at a single cloud outside and waved at it &ldquo;I hope it
      goes away, but we may have to find other things to do.&rdquo; There might
      be a lot of changes in our activities this summer.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      The girls dream of what they may do if they are able to go to the beach.
      &ldquo;Oh, we may build a sand castle, and swim.&rdquo; Amy said.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amanda smiled and replied, &ldquo;We might see dolphins too!&rdquo;&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      The girls laughed and closed their eyes, imagining their future trip.
      &ldquo;We might be able to get ice cream every day, but dad will probably
      say no.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever happens, we will have fun. If it rains, we may be able to
      go to the arcade.&rdquo; Amy said.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Amanda is thinking of other things they might do indoors instead of
      swimming.
