    <p>Ted: Hi, Jake. Have you thought about what you want to do after college?</p>

    <p>Jake: Hmm. I&rsquo;ve been checking different types of careers. But, my dream job as
        a kid was to be an astronomer. I would love to study about different planets. I know it is going to be
        difficult.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Ted: It may sound hard but you can always study about it. I always wanted to be a
        designer. I would love to design clothes and make my own clothes too.</p>

    <p>Jake: That is interesting. But you know I always admire people that work as an
        electrician. It must be dangerous to work with electric circuits.&nbsp;</p>
