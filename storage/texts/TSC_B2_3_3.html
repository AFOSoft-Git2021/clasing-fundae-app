    <p><span>Dear diary,</span></p>
    
    <p><span>I&rsquo;m currently studying for my finals. My classmates are also studying hard
            these days. Nowadays, I&rsquo;ve been listening to music. It helps me focus.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>At present, I&rsquo;m studying math. All I can do now is keep studying. I also
            don&rsquo;t have time to play these days. I&rsquo;ve been studying nonstop nowadays. The school is still
            teaching algebra in this day and age. My head is currently aching with all the numbers. I think I need to
            take some rest.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Yours,</span></p>
    <p><span>Lucy</span></p>
