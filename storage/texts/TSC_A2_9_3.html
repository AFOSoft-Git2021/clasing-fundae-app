    <p>I am Rina. My hobby is playing with dolls and soft toys.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      They are gifts from my parents and friends. I have two dolls. One of them
      has long yellow hair. I named her Goldie.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>The other has short, curly, black hair. Her name is Shasha.</p>
    <p>
      I like to change their clothes. I have different kinds of clothes for
      them.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, I let Shasha wear Goldie&rsquo;s long pants. Then Goldie has a
      colorful gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dolls have a mini salon to fix their hair. I like to comb their hair
      and give them different hairstyles.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      I also play with my other toys. I have a small white teddy bear, an orange
      giraffe and a pink chimpanzee. They all look so cute.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes I pick them up and hug them. I put these soft toys around my
      head.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      I have learned to be caring and responsible by taking good care of my
      toys.&nbsp;
