    <p>Dear Yoko</p>
    <p>
      Let me tell you about my family. I live with my mum, my dad and my big
      sister. We live in California. My mum&rsquo;s name is Carmen. She&rsquo;s
      Mexican and she speaks English and Spanish. She&rsquo;s a Spanish teacher.
      She&rsquo;s short and slim, she&rsquo;s got long, brown hair and brown
      eyes.

      My dad&rsquo;s name is David. He&rsquo;s American. He&rsquo;s tall and a
      little fat! He&rsquo;s got short brown hair and blue eyes. He works in a
      bank.

      My sister Shania is 14 and she loves listening to music. She listens to
      music all the time! She&rsquo;s got long brown hair and green eyes, like
      me. I&rsquo;ve got long hair too.
    </p>
    <p>
      We&rsquo;ve got a pet dog, Brandy. He&rsquo;s black and white and very
      friendly.

    <p>Write soon and tell me about your family.</p>

    <p>Love</p>
