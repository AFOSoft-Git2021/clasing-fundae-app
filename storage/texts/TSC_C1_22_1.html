		<b>Questions: TSC-C1_22_1 until C1_22_15</b>
	</h3>

	<p><b>Things
			People Regret the Most </b>
	</p>
	<p><b>1.
			Time</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Some
				people wish they could have given more time to their loved ones.
			</p>
		<li>
			<p>Some
				people wish they could have established a work-life balance routine.

			</p>
		<li>
			<p>Some
				people wish they could have started traveling at an early age.
			</p>
	</ul>

	<p><b>2.
			Worry less</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>There
				was research about people wishing they could have thought of asking
				for help instead of keeping their problems to themselves.
			</p>
		<li>
			<p>There
				were people saying they could have written the important and not so
				important things to do.</p>
		<li>
			<p>While
				others believe they could have been optimistic in life.
			</p>
	</ul>

	<p><b>3.
			Forgiveness</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Holding
				grunge is never healthy, other people believe they could have just
				forgotten the bad and focus on the good.
			</p>
		<li>
			<p>It
				can be too late to start wishing you could have forgiven people
				more.
			</p>
		<li>
			<p>Others
				say, they could have been strong, they could have learned to let go
				of the negativity.
			</p>
	</ul>


	<p><b>4.
			My life, my rules</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Spend
				your time doing what you love and not having to end up saying &ldquo;I
				wish I could have followed my passion in life.&rdquo;</p>
		<li>
			<p>It
				can be difficult to hear a lot of voices dictating what is good for
				you. Most people regret not following their guts, &ldquo;I could
				have listened to my intuition.&rdquo;, a person once said.
			</p>
		<li>
			<p>Some
				people believe they could have established a healthy boundary of
				saying no to other people&rsquo;s opinion about how to live their
				lives.
			</p>
	</ul>


	<p><b>5.
			Living for the moment</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>You
				have to make a difference today. Some people realize this sooner in
				life. &ldquo;I wish I could have started my own charity, I always
				wanted to help people in need.&rdquo;
			</p>
		<li>
			<p>Always
				ask yourself if there is anything you might regret later in life.
				There are people who say &ldquo;I could have known this would happen
				later on.&rdquo;</p>
		<li>
			<p>If
				not now, when? If dancing is always what you wanted, chase it and do
				it. &ldquo;I wish I could have taken that step.&rdquo; , don&rsquo;t
				wait for the time to say this line.
			</p>
	</ul>
