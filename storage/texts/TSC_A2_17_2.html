    <h3 class="ReferenciaInterna">Questions: TSC-A2_17_11 until A2_17_20</h3>

    <p>My name is Tom and I think I am the best student in class. I study harder than Jim
        because Jim is a bit lazy.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Tim, who sits across from me, is probably the laziest in our class.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I am also a better writer than Annie. I think she has the worst writing in class.
        But, Annie knows how to draw better than I do. I think she draws the best in class.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Ron, who sits behind me in class, is very helpful. He always helps everyone. I think
        he is the most helpful person in class.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Percy who sits beside me is very funny. He is funnier than Ron and the students think
        he is the funniest person in class because he makes us laugh.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>We do have the loudest student at the back, that would be Buck. He doesn&rsquo;t know
        when to be quiet.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>While Joe, he can be the quietest from all of us.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Suzie, who is the class president, is very beautiful. She wants to be a movie star
        one day. I think she is the most beautiful in our class.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>When I get older, I want to be the most successful businessman in town.&nbsp;
