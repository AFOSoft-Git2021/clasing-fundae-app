	<p>Dear
		diary,</p>

	<p>I
		expected Josh to have finished his part of our research. He claims to
		have finished his part. I believed Josh to have performed well. As it
		turns out, he pretended to have finished his part. I hope he has told
		the truth from the start. I
		would love for Josh not to have lied.</p>

	<p>Our
		group mates also believed Josh to have finished his part. Our group
		mates hate to have thought that I was covering for Josh. I claim not
		to have participated in his wrongdoing. We would hate to have
		pretended our research was going well with our teacher.</p>

	<p>We
		hope to have finished the research by next week. Our teacher hoped to
		have finished all the research by next week. Our teacher claims to
		have thought that the deadline was more than enough time. I preferred
		to have thought of a much more forgiving deadline. I would prefer to
		have moved to a different group.
	</p>

	<p>Sincerely,</p>
	<p>Dan.</p>
