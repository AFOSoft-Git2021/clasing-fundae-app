    <p>Lola: There is a party at my sister&#39;s house.
        Would you like to come?</p>

    <p>Peter: I&rsquo;ll be at my brother&rsquo;s house this
        afternoon. I will check if I can.</p>

    <p>Lola: Alright. We need some bread for the party, so
        if you come, can you buy some at Kim&rsquo;s bakeshop?</p>

    <p>Peter: I will call you. I should get your number, so
        I can call you.</p>

    <p>Lola: You can send a message to my sister&rsquo;s
        number. Mine is running out of battery.</p>

    <p>Peter: My phone&rsquo;s extra charger is in the car.
        You may use it for now.</p>

    <p>Lola: Thanks. Which one is your car?</p>

    <p>Peter: I am actually using my brother&rsquo;s car
        right now.</p>

    <p>Peter: He asked me to purchase carpenters&rsquo;
        tools. They are fixing something at their home.</p>

    <p>Lola: Oh. If you are working outside, you need to
        read today&rsquo;s news. It could rain today.</p>

    <p>Peter: Yeah. I heard about it. We have to get going
        and finish things for this evening&rsquo;s party.</p>

    <p>Lola: Alright. I have to bring James&rsquo;s artwork
        to the party.</p>
