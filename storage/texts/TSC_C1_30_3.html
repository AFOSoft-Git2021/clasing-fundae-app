	<p>To:
		Olivia Paulson</p>
	<p>From:
		Jonathan Hicks</p>
	<p>Date:
		July 19</p>
	<p>Subject:Procedural
		Review</p>

	<p>An
		issue was brought up over and over at the executives meeting last
		Thursday. Complaints of damaged goods after being shipped have
		increased dramatically time and time again.
	</p>
	<p>This
		may be a result of more fragile items being added to the products we
		now ship.
	</p>
	<p>Because
		of this, we utterly have temporarily suspended the shipping of
		accessories and other fragile items.</p>

	<p>It&rsquo;s
		high time to review the packaging procedures for our products.</p>
	<p>We
		are looking to add more steps to ensure that the products are
		packaged securely and delivered without damage.</p>
	<p>Please
		inform the managers on the manufacturing team to attend an emergency
		meeting tonight at 7:00 P.M.
	</p>
	<p>We
		hope to address this problem and come up with a sound solution in the
		nick of time.
	</p>
