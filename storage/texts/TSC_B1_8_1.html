    <p>Kurt:&nbsp;I heard you are looking for another job.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Tim:&nbsp;That&rsquo;s right. I have been having difficulties with other
      employees at work. I can&rsquo;t take it.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Kurt:&nbsp;Why don&rsquo;t you speak with your boss about it?</p>

    <p>
      Tim:&nbsp;There&rsquo;s no use. He called me the other day in his office,
      the others must have told him something about my problem.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Kurt:&nbsp;Is that so? You need to have another reason to stay at this job
      then.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Tim:&nbsp;Of course, I have other plans to engage with my workmates. What
      about you, how are you at work?
    </p>

    <p>
      Kurt:&nbsp;Well&hellip; Do you have other questions besides talking about
      work? I&rsquo;m kidding. Work is fine, I guess. The other week, I went to
      a conference. There were lots of attendees.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Tim:&nbsp;Was it the conference I saw on the poster in the town hall? It
      was in the Gates building.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Kurt: No, It is not the same that was another conference, the conference
      you were talking about is filing your taxes.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Tim:&nbsp;Oh that&rsquo;s right.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Kurt: There was this man, he didn&#39;t respect the other attendees, he
      kept on standing on his seat. I couldn&rsquo;t see the presentation
      properly.&nbsp;
