	<p>Dear
		Mr. Mills,</p>
	<p>I
		am writing in reply to your complaint about the noise that has been
		coming from the surrounding businesses around the apartment complex.
	</p>
	<p>A
		few people living on the west wing of the building have expressed to
		have been preparing a complaint over the noise levels.
	</p>
	<p>The
		building committee does not want to beat around the bush. Thus, they
		have conducted meetings over this issue.</p>
	<p>We
		have been talking to the businesses since the day it happened.
		However, some of the noises are inevitable due to the nature of their
		businesses.
	</p>
	<p>We
		don&rsquo;t want to cut corners. The best solution is something to be
		given to all tenants as soon as possible.</p>
	<p>Out
		of pocket, we are going to fortify the windows with noise-proof
		glass.
	</p>
	<p>Once
		we have finalized the proposals, the management has said to be
		bringing in the glasses soon.
	</p>
	<p>Until
		then, we ask for your continued patience.</p>
	<p>Alex
		Turner</p>
	<p>West
		Wing Complex
	</p>
	<p>Manager</p>
