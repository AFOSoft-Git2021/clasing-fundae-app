	<p> To: Nancy Craft</p>

	<p> From: Omar Patel</p>

	<p> Date:January 16</p>

	<p> Subject: Pre-shipping Procedures</p>

	<p> I am not going to beat around the bush, during the manufacturing team meeting, concern was raised that
		inventory wasn’t always being properly stored before being shipped.
	</p>

	<p> I don’t want to add fuel to the fire, so, the team and I decided to review the written procedure to
		determine if additional steps should be added.
	</p>

	<p> A meeting of the packaging and storage team has been set for Tuesday, January 23.
	</p>

	<p> Please try to arrange the schedules of the team in the packaging and storage wing, they might bring to the
		table some solutions.
	</p>

	<p> I don’t want to circle back with the same scenario in the future.</p>

	<p> I am confident that the packaging and storage team management will discover that the written procedure
		leaves no room for any inventory to accidentally be improperly stored.
	</p>

	<p> Any suggestions made by the packaging and storage team will be a game change enhancing our superior
		checklist. </p>
