      Ways to trick yourself into feeling confident, even when you&#39;re not.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Slumping can make you feel more sad, while sitting up straight and
        holding your head high can make you feel instantly more powerful.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Keeping a positive quote in your mind is always a good idea &mdash; it
        can help you feel good about yourself.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Every time you think something bad about yourself, immediately think of
        something good. You could always find something beautiful about
        yourself.&nbsp;
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Accept that criticism sucks and learn how to move past it.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        When you&#39;re feeling anxious, you can breathe deeply and slowly to
        calm yourself down.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        You probably have one thing in mind that you know makes you feel more
        confident. Maybe it&#39;s a dress you think you look great in, or maybe
        you could wear your favorite lipstick or perfume.&nbsp;
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Again, it&#39;s important to remember that confidence is a lifelong
      journey. It won&#39;t always be easy, even if you work really hard at it
      &mdash; and that&#39;s okay.
