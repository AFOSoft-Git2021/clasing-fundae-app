		Policy Change</p>

	<p>
		Dear
		Sales Agents,</p>
	<p>
		Recent
		change to our reimbursement policy has been made.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before,
		you simply had to pay out of pocket first then provide your receipts
		after renting vehicles, taking business trips, or incurring other
		business expenses.
	</p>
	<p>
		So,
		now you will be required to fill out an application which will need
		to be approved by the accounting department first.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then
		you will be provided with a company card which holds limited funds.
	</p>
	<p>
		Such
		situations occur like spending beyond the amount, you will have to
		pay out of your own pocket and will not be reimbursed for that.</p>
	<p>
		Below
		this email is an attachment to get further details on what expenses
		can and cannot be approved by the company.</p>
