      Toby is a puppy. He is Mister Roger&rsquo;s pet. When Mister Rogers goes
      to work, Toby feels lonely at home. That is why Mister Rogers takes his
      dog to a pet kindergarten every time he leaves the house for a long time.
      &nbsp;There are many kinds of dogs in the kindergarten for pets: large and
      small, fat and thin, long-haired and short-haired ones.

      Toby loves to run and play with the other dogs. But most of all, the puppy
      loves to put rubber balls in buckets. Toby has a lot of balls and only a
      few small buckets. He grabs a ball with his teeth and runs to a bucket. He
      puts the ball in a bucket and runs back for another ball. One, two, three
      balls- the first bucket is full. One, two, three, four balls-the second
      bucket is full. One, two, three balls &ndash; all the buckets are filled
      with balls. Toby is happy!
