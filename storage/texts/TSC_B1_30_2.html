    <p>Dear diary,</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>School has not started yet. What have I done in my free time? I have asked myself this question a lot.</p>
    <p>I have started learning how to paint. I have watched a lot of tutorials. I haven't learned something as beautiful as painting. I have blended unique colors. I have used it in my art pieces.</p>
    <p>My art pieces are unique. Each piece has possessed a bit of my soul.</p>
    <p>I have crossed a bridge lately. I have visited it for quite some time now. It seems like it has captured the attention of birds and other creatures. It has also captured my heart.</p>
    <p>I have observed the scene. But I haven't tried painting it yet. I don't know why I don't feel like it.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Yours,</p>
    <p>Joe.</p>
