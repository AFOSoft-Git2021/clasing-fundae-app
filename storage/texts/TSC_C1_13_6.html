		Upcoming Visit</p>

	<p>
		Dear
		Mr. Hanson,</p>
	<p>
		I
		am currently finalizing all the details to be brought for my visit to
		your company’s headquarters in Santa Fe.
	</p>

	<p>
		I
		am thankful to be invited to take part in these business
		negotiations.
	</p>

	<p>
		Am
		I expected to be picked up at the airport on an early call?
	</p>

	<p>
		Please
		let me know what time I should arrive. Will the meeting begin after
		lunchtime like it did last time?</p>

	<p>
		Fortunately,
		a new bus line was set to be established between where I live and
		your offices. It has made transit in the Southwestern region
		considerably convenient.</p>

	<p>
		There
		are routes that now travel to Denver and Phoenix as well. Also,
		thanks to some lucky circumstances, At Santa Fe. The ticket that I
		need is now easier to be reserved at half price.</p>
	<p>
		I
		can’t wait to see you and your co-workers again soon.</p>
	<p>
		Dan
		Gregory</p>
