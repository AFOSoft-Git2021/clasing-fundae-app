    <p>Susy: Let me pay for your groceries. I can see it is not
        much.</p>

    <p>Ben: Thanks, Susy. Did you get something for
        yourself?</p>

    <p>Susy: I did the grocery for my sister, these are not
        mine.</p>

    <p>Ben: That&rsquo;s sweet of you. I always have problems
        doing my groceries.</p>

    <p>Susy: My mom always tells me to write down the most
        important things.</p>

    <p>Ben: You are right about that. Just between you and me,
        I hate writing.</p>

    <p>Susy: I used to hate writing but when I started doing
        groceries, I needed to help myself in writing.</p>

    <p>Ben: It is difficult to live alone, right? I&rsquo;ve
        been living on my own for a year now.</p>

    <p>Susy: I am living with my sister now but I am planning
        to get my own place.</p>

    <p>Ben: Good luck with that. You can text me if you need to
        know something or I can get your number.</p>

    <p>Susy: I will definitely text you. Here, I&rsquo;ll give
        you my number.</p>
