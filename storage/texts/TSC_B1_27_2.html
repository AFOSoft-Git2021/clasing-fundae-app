    <p>My name is Allan. I learn something new everyday.</p>
    <p>I used to come home sweating after riding a bike,</p>
    <p>Now, I always bring extra shirts if I go for a long ride.</p>
    <p>My mom yells at me if I don&rsquo;t bring extra shirts. I always make sure to bring
        it.</p>
    <p>When my mom is mad, I make her some of her favorite dishes to make her feel
        better.</p>
    <p>If she eats her favorite food, she forgets that I forgot to do my
        homework.</p>
    <p>Even though my mom gets mad, I love her dearly.</p>
    <p>When she goes shopping, she buys the things I need. When we eat out, we go to a nice
        restaurant that I like.</p>
    <p>If I get sick, she always makes the best soup. If I have a cold, she usually catches
        it. At the end, she still thinks about me.</p>
    <p>My mom still cleans the house if she is sick. I always tell her, If she is tired, she
        must go to bed early. </p>
