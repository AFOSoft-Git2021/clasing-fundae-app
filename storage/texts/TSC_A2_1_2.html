    <h1>Lulu and the strange noise</h1>
    <p>
      It was late in the evening. It was foggy and the streets were empty.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Lulu was coming back home. She was walking down the shadowy street.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      She wanted to be back home quickly, so she decided to take a short cut.
    </p>

    <p>She didn&rsquo;t know the place very well.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      She started to walk around the river. Then went over the bushy
      grass.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Suddenly, she heard a strange noise behind her.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>She started looking towards the grass&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

    <p>When a black cat jumped!&nbsp;</p>

    <p>She fell down on her knees then ran.&nbsp;</p>
