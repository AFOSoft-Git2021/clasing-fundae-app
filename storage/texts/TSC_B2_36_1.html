    <p><span>Trafficking in human beings: Commission proposes stronger rules to fight the
            evolving crime</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Today, the Commission proposed to strengthen the rules that prevent and combat
            trafficking in human beings.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Every year over 7000 people become victims of human trafficking in the EU. That
            figure can be expected to be much higher as many victims remain undetected.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>The majority of victims are women and girls, but the share of male victims is also on
            the rise for labour exploitation.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Forms of exploitation have evolved in recent years, with the crime increasingly
            taking into an online dimension.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>The updated rules will provide stronger tools for law enforcement and judicial
            authorities to investigate and prosecute new forms of exploitation.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>In particular, the updated rules will include:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li><span>Forced marriage and illegal adoption are among the types of
                exploitation. This will require Member States to criminalise such conduct in their national criminal law
                as human trafficking.</span></li>
        <li><span>Human trafficking offences committed through communication
                technologies, including internet and social media.</span></li>
        <li><span>Mandatory sanctions for legal persons held accountable for
                trafficking offences. They permanently close the establishments where the trafficking offence
                happened.</span></li>
        <li><span>Formal National Referral Mechanisms to improve early
                identification and referral for assistance and support for victims.</span></li>
        <li><span>Stepping up demand reduction by making it a criminal offence
                for people who knowingly use services provided by victims of trafficking.</span></li>
        <li><span>EU-wide annual data collection on trafficking in human
                beings to be published by Eurostat.</span></li>
    </ul>
