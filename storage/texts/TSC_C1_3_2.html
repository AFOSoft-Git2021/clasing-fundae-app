	<p><b>To
			have a pet or not to have a pet?</b></p>


	</p>
	<p>Sandra:Peter,
		Do you prefer to have a pet or not to have a pet?</p>


	</p>
	<p>Peter:
		Hmmm, that's a good question. Well, I have had a pet. A dog, it has a
		curly-haired and long-legged. She's very eye-catching because of the
		color of her fur. She knows how to do different tricks, it's
		mind-blowing! I started to teach her when she was just a puppy, she’s
		very smart. How about you Sandra, do you have a pet?</p>


	</p>
	<p>Sandra:Oh
		yes, I had a pet before named petty. It’s a hamster, we were
		together for a couple of years but then petty died, I think she got
		sick or something. It was soul-destroying for me, because every time
		I arrived home she’s the first one I always see. It was a good
		memory of petty.</p>


	</p>
	<p>Peter:Sorry
		to hear that… but would you mind having a new pet again in the
		future?</p>


	</p>
	<p>
		Sandra:Yeah,
		why not. Pets are lovely, they are heart-warming. They are good
		company.
	</p>


	</p>
	<p>Peter:Totally
		Agree…</p>
