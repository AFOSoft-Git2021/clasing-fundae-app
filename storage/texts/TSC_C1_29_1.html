	<p><b>Village of Cranton Wins Funding</b></p>

	<p>CRANTON,
		March 22&mdash;The Institute of Rural Service announced today that
		the village of Cranton is indeed
		this year&rsquo;s recipient of the Educational Development Grant.
	</p>
	<p>The
		grant will be used to fund the construction of a large playground
		that will provide recreational activities for children at least under
		12.
	</p>
	<p>Since
		the opening of the new electronics factory last year, the number of
		families in the area has risen very dramatically.
	</p>
	<p>As
		a result, children have been left absolutely with less and less space
		to play in.
	</p>
	<p>The
		new playground will allow children to play and enjoy themselves when
		they are not at school.</p>

	<p>Cranton
		is very proud to be the recipient of this grant and plans to apply
		for more grants in the future to improve the living conditions of the
		town and attract more residents.</p>
