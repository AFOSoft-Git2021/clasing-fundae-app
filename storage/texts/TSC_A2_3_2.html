    <h1>Jacob and his first day at school&nbsp;</h1>

    <p>What a beautiful day it is to start school!&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      It is a bit cold outside and I have to bring a red jacket! It is cloudy
      too!
    </p>

    <p>I hope I meet a lot of friends on my first day at school.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      There was this boy who is in the same class as me, I like his curly black
      hair.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      He talks a bit fast in class. He seems very smart in our English
      class.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Amanda, who sat down in front of me in class, is kind and quiet.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>She loves to draw colorful houses.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      When I finished my class, I played with Simon at the park and my clothes
      got so dirty!&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      But as soon as I arrived home, I told my parents everything that happened
      today.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>I am curious about what will happen the next day!&nbsp;</p>
