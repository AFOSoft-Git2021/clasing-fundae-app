    <p>Lorde: Hey Ruiji, an art museum is up next week. I wish
        to go there with you.</p>

    <p>Ruiji: I wish to see you there. But I might have a tight
        schedule next week.</p>

    <p>Lorde: Why are you busy next week? I wish to speak to
        your mother and complain. </p>

    <p>Ruiji: There&rsquo;s just a lot going on at school. I
        didn&rsquo;t wish to be so busy with school.</p>

    <p>Lorde: I&rsquo;m just joking. I didn&rsquo;t wish to
        have a tense conversation with you.</p>
    <p>Ruiji: Okay, one of my assignments involves art and I
        wish to paint somewhere quiet.</p>

    <p>Lorde: So where are you going to paint?</p>

    <p>Ruiji: I wish to go up the mountains. I also wish
        someone would appear to help me paint.</p>

    <p>Lorde: You know you don&rsquo;t have to wish for that.
        I&rsquo;ll go there with you. So how are we going to go there?</p>

    <p>Ruiji: I wish to go there by riding a horse, but I think
        a bus would be more convenient.</p>

    <p>Lorde: Sounds great! I wish to sit in the window
        seat.</p>

    <p>Ruiji: Okay, fine. I wish to
        drive you there, but I don&rsquo;t have my licence yet. I also wish to show you where I go when I feel like
        painting.</p>

    <p>Lorde: I didn&rsquo;t wish for you to bring me
        there. But I&rsquo;m so excited!</p>

    <p>Ruiji: I&rsquo;m also excited! </p>
