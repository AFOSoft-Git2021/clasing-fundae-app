	<p>Dear
		Mr. Rivers,</p>

	<p>I
		have been instructed to send a report regarding the condition of the
		kitchen. The kitchen has been renovated. The equipment has been
		replaced. Kitchen waste has been disposed of properly. The inventory
		has been restocked. The delivery has been received. The products have
		been delivered. The inspection has been taken care of. The power
		shortage has been dealt with. The interior of the kitchen has been
		designed by a professional.
	</p>

	<p>Regarding
		the recruitment, the candidates have been interviewed. New recruits
		have been trained. The new manager has been introduced to the team.
		Daily reports have been written. John has been promoted. The
		advertisement has been aired. Flyers have been handed off. The new
		teams have been assembled. The recent conflict has been handled. The
			appeal of a change in shifts has been considered.</p>

	<p>
		The
			kitchen is in top-notch condition. Everything about the kitchen has
			been taken care of.
