      Questions: TSC-A2_31_21 until TSC-A2_31_30
    </h3>

    <p>Our solar system</p>
    <p>
      Our solar system was formed about 4.5 billion years ago! But what exactly
      is the solar system? It consists of our sun and eight main planets:
      Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. There
      are also moons, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, rocks and dust.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Planets</p>
    <p>
      All of the planets in the solar system orbit the sun. Mercury, Venus,
      Earth and Mars are called &#39;terrestrial planets&#39;. They are mostly
      made of rock and metal. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are called
      &#39;gas giants&#39;. They are mostly composed of gas and they have
      rings.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      The smallest planet is Mercury and the biggest is Jupiter. Neptune is the
      coldest and Venus is the hottest planet.
    </p>

    <p>Moons</p>
    <p>
      Moons travel around planets. Earth has got just one moon, but there are at
      least 150 moons in our solar system. Jupiter and Saturn are the planets
      with the most - 53 confirmed moons each! Mercury and Venus have no moons
      at all.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Stars</p>
    <p>
      Stars are enormous balls of very hot gas. Our closest star is the sun, and
      it&#39;s 150 million km away from planet Earth! Without the sun&#39;s
      energy, there would be no life on Earth.
    </p>

    <p>Space missions</p>
    <p>
      Yuri Gagarin became the first human to travel in space in 1961. Then, in
      1969, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon as part
      of the Apollo 11 mission. There have been many more missions to space
      since!

    <p>
      An easy way to remember the order of the planets is to use a special
      sentence, such as &#39; My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us
      Noodles&#39;.&nbsp;The first letter of each word is the first letter of
      each planet.
