    <p>Agent: Skyscanner Travel. How can I help you?</p>
    <p>Loe: Yes. I need a flight from London to Bangkok on September 20th. Can you find me
        the least expensive flight?</p>
    <p>Agent: Would you prefer to leave from Gatwick or Heathrow Airport?</p>
    <p>Loe: I want to fly out of Gatwick Airport.</p>
    <p>Agent: Let me see. Yes. I have a 5:30 flight on Thai Airways.</p>
    <p>Loe: 5.30! What&rsquo;s the check in time?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Agent: One hour for economy class and thirty minutes for business class. Will you
        take that?</p>
    <p>Loe: No. I won&rsquo;t get to the airport in time. When will the next flight
        leave?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Agent: There won&rsquo;t be another direct flight on Saturday. There will be one on
        Friday at the same time.</p>
    <p>Loe: I can&rsquo;t leave before September 20th. What about from Heathrow
        Airport?</p>
    <p>Agent: Just let me check. Oh, there is an 8:30 flight on British Airways.</p>
    <p>Loe: How much will that be?</p>
    <p>Agent: Economy class costs &pound;386.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Loe:Alright, let&rsquo;s go with that.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Agent: How many seats would you like?</p>
    <p>Loe: Just one seat. May I request a window seat, please?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Agent: Would you like a return ticket?</p>
    <p>Loe: No, thanks. When will you send my boarding pass?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Agent: You will receive the boarding pass after paying.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Agent: Lastly, the maximum weight per luggage is 23 kg.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Loe: Thank you!&nbsp;</p>
