    <p>Helen-&nbsp;Hi, Mum, How&#39;s it going?</p>

    <p>Mum-&nbsp;Fine thanks, honey. How was school?</p>

    <p>Helen-&nbsp;Good. I&#39;ve got a note for you from Mr Oliveira.</p>

    <p>Mum-&nbsp;Who&#39;s Mr Oliveira? Your Portuguese teacher?</p>

    <p>Helen-&nbsp;I don&#39;t study Portuguese, Mum. You know that.</p>

    <p>Mum-&nbsp;True.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Helen-Mum, he&#39;s the new headmaster at college. And he isn&#39;t
      Portuguese or Brazilian. He&#39;s British. But I think he said his parents
      are from Goa.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mum-&nbsp;Goa? Wow. The headmaster ... Ah yes, I remember him. I met him
      during Christmas when I went to your school for that concert.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Helen- Mum &hellip;</p>

    <p>
      Mum-&nbsp;It would be good to speak to him about his parents&#39; country.
      I could interview him, then visit Goa in summer.
    </p>

    <p>Helen- Well, he&#39;d like to see you again too.</p>

    <p>Mum-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?</p>

    <p>
      Helen-&nbsp;The headmaster wants you to go to school on Monday next week.
    </p>

    <p>Mum-&nbsp;Oh? Have you done something wrong?</p>

    <p>
      Helen-&nbsp;No, of course not! He wants to ask if you can give a talk
      about your work and your travels. It will happen one day in April, during
      Career&rsquo;s Week on campus.
    </p>

    <p>Mum-&nbsp;So on Monday or Tuesday? What time?</p>

    <p>
      Helen-&nbsp;Can you try to go on campus in the early evening? At 5
      o&#39;clock, if you can.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mum-&nbsp;Hmm. I can go to your campus at half past four on Tuesday, if
      that&#39;s OK.
    </p>

    <p>Helen-&nbsp;I&#39;ll ask.</p>

    <p>
      Mum-&nbsp;Let me see. I&#39;m away in Moscow for three days. In April, I
      will have a project in Thailand.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Helen-&nbsp;You have a busy schedule. For me, I&rsquo;ll be busy with
      activities during our school holiday.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mum-&nbsp;I am staying in Russia for two weeks to write about traditions.
      I can&#39;t go on Monday evening, because I have a tai chi class, and then
      I have to work at night. I have a video call at midnight... Yes,
      definitely. I&#39;ll go in on Tuesday evening.
    </p>

    <p>Helen-Can you write a note or send him an email, please?</p>

    <p>
      Mum-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ll phone him
      during the day tomorrow. I&#39;m free for a few hours in the morning.
