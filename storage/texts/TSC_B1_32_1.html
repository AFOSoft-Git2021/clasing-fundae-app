    <h3 class="ReferenciaInterna">Dear diary,</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>I was late for school because I had missed the bus. But I received a good mark in my test because I had reviewed it well. At School, I quickly copied the homework that I had not done. All day long, Jack was mad at me because I had not greeted him first.</p>
    <p>When I met mom at ten o'clock, she had not had breakfast yet. When we came back home, it was cold in the house because my brother had not closed the windows.</p>
    <p>We ate at a restaurant last night because my mom had not bought anything for dinner. In the shopping center. I met a friend I had not seen for ages. We talked about the food we had not eaten. We ate snacks we had not eaten before.</p>
    <p>I read a book. It's about a family. They lived in the house that their father had built. They watered the trees that they had planted. They admired the picture that Michelangelo had painted. They lived in an era where they had never seen a phone. Their father was in the hospital because he had slipped on a banana skin.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Matthew.</p>
