    <p>Ann is having a birthday party.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      She is six years old today. Ann told her mother she would like a very
      special cake for her sixth birthday.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      She said she wanted a birthday cake with three layers: A large layer on
      the bottom, a medium-sized layer in the middle and a small layer on
      top.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother went into the kitchen. She is very happy because her mother
      baked her cake exactly like she wanted.&nbsp;
