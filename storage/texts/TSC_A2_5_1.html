    <p>One day, a boy named Dominic decided to plant a magical tree.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Dominic sat down on the floor. Then, he dug a hole in the ground.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>He planted a seed and the tree grew!</p>

    <p>
      The tree grew so fast, within a day it was already taller than the boy!
    </p>

    <p>
      Soon, the tree had delicious apples that hung from its branches.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Dominic wanted to make an apple pie with apples from the tree.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      To get the apples, He shook the tree and apples fell to the ground.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      He picked up the apples off of the ground and took them inside the
      kitchen.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>There, he cut the apples into tiny pieces and made a pie.&nbsp;</p>
