    <p>I just figured that my sad feelings are not that bad.</p>

    <p>There is no other way to start than to tell you that I am truly blessed. I grew up in
        a warm, close family that supported me with my dreams. I&rsquo;ve got friends who love me. My parents
        afforded me every great opportunity that you can possibly imagine.</p>

    <p>I went to summer camp. I traveled all over the country to play hockey.

    <p>Despite having it just about as good as a kid could ask, from a young age, I
        experienced sad feelings that I couldn&rsquo;t explain myself.</p>

    <p>I just figured that my sad feelings are not that bad.</p>

    <p>Fast-forward to the start of college. Those feelings were always there, but about to
        get much worse.</p>

    <p>When my parents dropped me off at school, it was the first time that I had to deal
        with my own emotions.</p>

    <p>I didn&rsquo;t have the chance to cry to my mom like I did before. Like when I came
        home from high school or I even locked myself in my room after a bad day in school.</p>

    <p>This was a new turn in my life that I was not prepared for at all. There wasn&rsquo;t
        anybody who could help me out.</p>
