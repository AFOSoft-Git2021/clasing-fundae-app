	<p>John hollers, "Come out and play," as Jacob weeps, begging his mom to let him play. His mom sniggers as Jacob
			whines about not being allowed to play outside all the time.
			</p>

	<p>Jacob’s mom put up a smile. “Go out and play just–” Jacob hurried and giggled on his way out, not letting his mom
			finish her sentence. The floorboards creak as they carry Jacob’s excitement.</p>


	<p>"JUST BE CAREFUL!," her mom yelled, putting an exclamation mark on her interrupted sentence. </p>


	<p>John and Jacob run to the field. Their cackle echoes on the field. They bawled, trying to recreate the cow’s
			bellow.</p>

	<p>John accidentally stepped on the cow’s foot. It stretched out its limbs while it wailed. John whimpers when he
			gets in the way of the cow’s foot.</p>


	<p>John sobs in pain while Jacob sniggers. Jacob’s patter kept John in a good mood.</p>
