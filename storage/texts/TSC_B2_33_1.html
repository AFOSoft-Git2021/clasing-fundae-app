    <p>Carma:&nbsp;You look stressed. Give yourself some time to enjoy life.</p>

    <p>
      Kath:&nbsp;I want to enjoy my youth, but sometimes I don&rsquo;t know how.
    </p>

    <p>
      Carma:&nbsp;That&rsquo;s something you don&rsquo;t have to solve alone. My
      warmth will be here to assist you.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Kath:&nbsp;Thanks Carma. I want to spend some time with my friends, but I
      want to avoid petty fights.
    </p>

    <p>
      Carma:&nbsp;Maybe you have to be picky with the people you want to hang
      out with. You have to monitor how people affect you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kath:&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not the type to make a fuss about how people treat
      me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Carma:&nbsp;I am here to encourage you to change. Your fate is in your
      hands. Be wary of your decisions if you don&rsquo;t want to pay the price.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kath:&nbsp;For now, I&rsquo;ll figure out a way to cope with this. I want
      to decide my own fate. I think the sensible thing to do is to listen to
      you, but I want to solve my own problems. I don&rsquo;t want to pay the
      price, so I&rsquo;ll have to do better.
