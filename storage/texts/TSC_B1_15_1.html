    <p>My name is David. I am going to compete in a table tennis tournament this
        weekend. </p>

    <p>I will practice all week because I want to win the tournament. The winner will
        receive 1000 dollars!</p>

    <p>My father will travel to the tournament with me. My trainer will be there to train
        me.</p>

    <p>My mother won&#39;t come to the tournament because she will be at work.
    </p>

    <p>But my sister will come after her class. She will sit in the stands and cheer for me.
        My family will be proud of me if I win the tournament.</p>

    <p>If I win the tournament I will buy a new laptop for my father. But he doesn&#39;t
        know it. I will give this as a gift for his birthday. I hope I will win the tournament.</p>
