    <h1>Brother Rivalry</h1>
    <p>
      Once upon a time, there were two brothers named Ed and Ted who always
      competed against each other. No matter how hard Ted tried, Ed always did
      everything better.
    </p>
    <p>
      See, Ed was 1 year&nbsp;older&nbsp;than his brother Ted. And when they
      measured their heights, Ed was always one foot&nbsp;taller&nbsp;than his
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      They loved kicking the soccer ball, but no matter how hard Ted tried, Ed
      always kicked the ball&nbsp;farther than&nbsp;his brother Ted. When they
      played basketball too, Ed always jumped&nbsp;higher&nbsp;than his brother
      too. Finally, when they ran to the finish line, Ed was always a couple of
      seconds&nbsp;faster&nbsp;than Ted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted was going to give up on being the best because his brother was always
      better than everything he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ed and Ted were both exhausted. Their mom called them back into the house
      for dinner. They sat down at the table but it was Ted who
      was&nbsp;hungrier&nbsp;than his brother because he ate his whole meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that point, both boys realized that you can&rsquo;t be better at
      everything than your brother in life.
