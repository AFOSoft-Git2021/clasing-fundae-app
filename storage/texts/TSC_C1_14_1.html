		<b>Questions: TSC-C1_14_1 until C1_14_5</b>
	</h3>

	<p>
		Man:
		Hi, This suit should be cleaned by tomorrow.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&rsquo;m
		going overseas to have a blast with friends and all my suits are
		getting a bit old now. How much would be deducted on my card?</p>
	<p>
		Worker:
		Hmm... Usually twenty dollars. But this one will cost a bit more.</p>
	<p>
		Man:
		Really? That price must have been over the top. On your price list,
		it says twenty dollars.</p>
	<p>
		Worker:
		Well, yes. This suit is going to take longer to clean since it has
		thicker fabrics which is not a doddle thing to do.</p>
	<p>
		It
		might have required more products. It will incur an additional
		surcharge.</p>
	<p>
		Man:
		Hmm... I could have taken it somewhere else. I won&rsquo;t spend more
		than twenty bucks.</p>
	<p>
		Worker:
		OK. You are pulling my leg over her but fine I will do it for twenty
		dollars. And whenever you need a suit cleaned, please come back to
		me.</p>
