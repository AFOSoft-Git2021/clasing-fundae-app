    <p>Dear diary,</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I've been thinking. If I had one wish, what would I wish for?</p>
    <p>If I had one wish, I would wish for the world to be a better place. But I think my mom would get mad if I didn't wish for financial stability. I think I need to think of another wish.</p>
    <p>If I had one wish, I would wish for unlimited money. But I think it would be unfair if I wished for something only I could benefit from.</p>
    <p>Finally! I think I have come up with the best wish.</p>
    <p>If I had one wish, I would wish for unlimited wishes. I would be able to help others and provide for myself if I had unlimited wishes.</p>
    <p>It's kind of scary, though. Would I be corrupted by the power if I had unlimited wishes?</p>
    <p>What if everyone had one wish? I think everyone would be able to rewrite their whole life if they had one wish.</p>
    <p>How about you diary? If you had one wish, what would you wish for?</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Yours,</p>
    <p>Ryan</p>
