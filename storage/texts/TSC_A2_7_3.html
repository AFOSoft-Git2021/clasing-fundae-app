    <p>
      When Franken was living in a haunted house, he was scaring people when
      they were visiting.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>He was making scary noises.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>He wasn&rsquo;t sleeping all day.</p>

    <p>
      He was staying awake day and night so that he wasn&rsquo;t missing a
      chance to scare visitors.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>He was turning off all the lights in the house at night.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      He wasn&rsquo;t walking or running, he was floating near the ceiling. He
      was wearing his skeleton costume all the time.
    </p>

    <p>
      People are taking another way so they would not pass by his haunted
      house.&nbsp;
