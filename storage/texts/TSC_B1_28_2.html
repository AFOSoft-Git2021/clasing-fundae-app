    <p>Megan: Hi Cindy, Where will you go today?
    </p>
    
    <p>Cindy: Hmm.. If it is sunny this afternoon, I will go to
            the beach. But, if it rains this afternoon, I will watch my favorite TV show. And you?</p>
    
    <p>Megan: I wish I can go with you to the beach. I have a
            meeting this afternoon. If the attendees don&rsquo;t come, I&rsquo;ll have to cancel the presentation. I
            will go to the nearest cafe instead.</p>
    
    <p>Cindy: If you need someone to join you, I will be
            there.</p>
    
    <p>Megan: I will call you if my cousin will not join
            me.</p>
   
    <p>Cindy: Or if you come to my house this evening, we will
            watch a movie together.</p>
    
    <p>Megan: That sounds like a good plan!</p>
    
    <p>Cindy: My mom will be delighted if you join us for
            dinner.</p>
    
    <p>Megan: If the presentation finishes early, I will go to
            your house as soon as possible.</p>
    
    <p>Cindy: By the way, If you see Wendy at work, please tell
            her I will meet her at the station at 5.</p>
    
    <p>Megan: I will tell her. I have to go now, if I
            don&rsquo;t hurry, I will miss the bus.</p>
    
    <p>Cindy: OK! Talk to you later! Bye!</p>
    
    <p>Megan: Bye Cindy!</p>
