    <h3 class="ReferenciaInterna">Questions: TSC-B1_18_16 until B1_18_30</h3>

    <p>Alex: What work advice you wished you had heard
        sooner? </p>

    <p>Brit: As an HR, I should have known to do more for a
        30-minute meeting. It sucks to sit there for an hour and listen. </p>

    <p>Colt: I could have had more casual conversations
        with other workmates. </p>

    <p>Don: I would have listened to criticism and taken it
        more positively. </p>

    <p>Earl: We must limit our tasks daily. I must have
        flooded my daily tasks in the past. </p>

    <p>Gab: Don&rsquo;t expect to achieve anything if you
        don&rsquo;t know your goal. I should have listed what I want to achieve. </p>

    <p>Helen: I could have celebrated any win, even if it
        is a small one.</p>

    <p>Ivan: I must have played to my strength. I should
        have found what I am good at. </p>

    <p>Lea: I should not have burned bridges. I should have
        kept it to myself even if I hate a workmate. </p>

    <p>Travis: I used to say no to challenges. I could have
        seen it as an opportunity. </p>

    <p>Macy: When it comes to the marketing field, I should
        have used the correct images or words to bring out the best results. </p>

    <p>Nat: Don&rsquo;t be stuck on the &lsquo;what
        if&rsquo; question. I must have been hiding in my shell all this time. </p>

    <p>Paolo: I think when you use someone&rsquo;s
        resources, it is good to give them credit. I could have done more of that. </p>

    <p>Oliv: I guess, I could have followed what I really
        love to do so I won&rsquo;t get tired going to work. </p>
