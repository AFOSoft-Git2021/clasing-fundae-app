		<b>Questions: TSC-C1_12_21 until C1_12_25</b>
	</h3>

	<p>Man:
		Hello. The television cable has been being arranged since two hours
		ago.
	</p>
	<p>Unfortunately,
		I will have to leave because of some urgent matters.</p>
	<p>The
		meeting is believed to have been being handled by my coworker for
		hours.
	</p>

	<p>Woman:
		OK,
		that shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. We apologize for the long
		duration. The cables have been being fixed since 7 this morning.
	</p>
	<p>If
		you wish to reschedule, there is a charge. That&rsquo;s our company&rsquo;s
		policy.
	</p>

	<p>Man:
		Oh, I see. That&rsquo;s not an issue. I hope all the wires have been
		being counted correctly.
	</p>

	<p>Woman:
		Don&rsquo;t worry, these things have been being dealt with seriously
		by our electrician. Please check the email and pay all your bills
		through our website.</p>
