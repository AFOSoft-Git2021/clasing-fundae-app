      Peter&rsquo;s uncle lived in the country. Once Peter went to stay with him
      for a few weeks.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever they went for a walk or for a drive in the car and they passed
      somebody, his uncle waved.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter was surprised, and said, &lsquo;Uncle George, you know everybody
      here. Where did you meet them all?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know all these people,&rsquo; said his uncle.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>&lsquo;Then why do you wave to them?&rsquo; asked Peter.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I wave to someone and he knows me, he is pleased. He continues
      his journey with a happier heart.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      But when I wave to someone and he doesn&rsquo;t know me, he is surprised
      and says to himself, &lsquo;Who is that man? Why did he wave at me?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They have something to think about during the rest of his journey.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>I make their journey short and I am happy.&rsquo;</p>
