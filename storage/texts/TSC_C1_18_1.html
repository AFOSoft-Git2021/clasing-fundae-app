		<b>Questions: TSC-C1_18_1 until C1_18_10</b>
	</h3>

	<p>November
		11</p>
	<p>John
		Adams</p>
	<p>Tri-State,
		Apt 408</p>
	<p>New
		York, NY</p>
	<p>10873</p>

	<p>Dear
		Mr. Adams,</p>
	<p>I
		am pleased to inform you that the campaign has certainly succeeded in
		raising public awareness of the issue.</p>
	<p>Fortunately,
		we have younger generations signing up for our upcoming event.</p>
	<p>The
		attendees actually spread the campaign on social media.</p>
	<p>They
		appear to actually like the message behind it, which I find
		incredible.</p>
	<p>We
		naturally pay for advertisements but this one, it is done by the
		attendees.
	</p>


	<p>We
		obviously need to prepare presentations and have a meeting soon.
	</p>
	<p>Presumably,
		we need to bring in some samples on the side effects of tobacco and
		vape.
	</p>
	<p>I&rsquo;ll
		be handling the videos, I hope you are willing to print out pictures.

	</p>
	<p>I
		am actually thinking of hiring a host that the youth is familiar
		with.
	</p>
	<p>Presumably,
		a host who dealt with cutting down smoking habits.
	</p>

	<p>Unfortunately,
		I can only meet you within this week.
	</p>
	<p>I
		hope to see you soon.</p>

	<p>Sincerely,</p>
	<p>Jennifer
		Law
	</p>
	<p>Executive
		Manager</p>
