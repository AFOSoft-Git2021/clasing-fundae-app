    <p>Hi Lucia,</p>
    <p>
      How are you? It was so nice to meet you last week in Sydney at the sales
      meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp; How was the rest of your trip? Did you see any
      kangaroos? I hope you got home to Mexico City OK. &nbsp; Anyway, I have
      the documents about the new Berlin offices. We&#39;re going to be open in
      three months. I moved here from London just last week.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      They are very nice offices, and the location is perfect.&nbsp;&nbsp; There
      are lots of restaurants, I found a vegetarian restaurant
      here.&nbsp;There&#39;s also public transport; we are next to an U-Bahn
      (that is the name for the metro here).&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>Maybe you can come and see them one day?</p>
    <p>
      I would love to show you Berlin, especially in the winter.&nbsp;You said
      you have never seen snow &ndash; you will see lots here!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here&#39;s a photo of you and me at the restaurant in Sydney. That was a
      very fun night!&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember the singing Englishman? Crazy! Please send me any other photos
      you have of that night. Good memories.
    </p>
    <p>Please give me your email address and I will send you the documents.</p>
    <p>Bye for now</p>
    <p>Mikel</p>
