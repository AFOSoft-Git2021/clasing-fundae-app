    <p><span">Dear diary,</span></p>
    
    <p><span">If I learn how to play guitar, I can possibly make a song. My writing skill is
            undoubtedly one of the best.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p><span">Apparently, my brother is going to sell his guitar. I obviously don&rsquo;t have the
            money for it. I will surely buy it when I have enough money.</span></p>
    
    <p><span">I&rsquo;ve been watching tutorial videos. Playing the guitar is indeed hard. I
            obviously need time to learn.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>My brother is undoubtedly one of the best guitarists. With time, I can possibly
            play better than my brother. I will surely surpass him.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Sincerely,</span></p>
    <p><span">Adam.</span></p>
