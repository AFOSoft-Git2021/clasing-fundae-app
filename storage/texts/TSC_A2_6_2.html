      Last week, Beth baked a cake for Lilly&rsquo;s birthday party. Lilly
      wanted a strawberry cake with pink frosting. Beth was happy to bake the
      cake.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      First, Beth mixed the ingredients in a big bowl. Next, she poured the cake
      batter into four round baking pans.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      She put the pans in the oven. Finally, she baked the cakes for 20
      minutes.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, Beth prepared the pink frosting. After the cakes cooled, Beth
      stacked them and covered them with frosting.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Beth wrote Lilly&#39;s name on top of the cake with white frosting.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>She put seven candles in the cake.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      On Sunday, Beth surprised Lilly with the strawberry cake. Lilly loved her
      cake!&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Lilly had many gifts for her birthday. But Lilly said her cake was the
      best gift of them all!&nbsp;
