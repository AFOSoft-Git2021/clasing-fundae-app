    <p>Jane and Patrick talk about Jane&rsquo;s plan to take a vacation in San Francisco in
        the United States.</p>

    <p>Jane: Guess what! I&rsquo;m going to San Francisco!</p>
    <p>Patrick: Really? When?</p>
    <p>Jane: Tomorrow. I&rsquo;m flying with Ocean Airlines.</p>
    <p>Patrick: Do you need a ride to the airport?</p>
    <p>Jane: No, thanks. I&rsquo;m OK. I am going to the airport by taxi. Have you ever been
        to San Francisco?</p>
    <p>Patrick: Yes. I have been there several times. There are many interesting places that
        you can visit. You should visit the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
    <p>Jane: What&rsquo;s the fastest way to go to the Golden Gate Bridge?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Patrick: From the airport, you should take the subway.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Jane: What about Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf?</p>
    <p>Patrick: Oh, that&rsquo;s one of my favorites! There are lots of seafood restaurants
        you can sit at for lunch. Where are you going to stay?</p>
    <p>Jane: I have booked a room at the Pacific Tradewinds Hostel. I will take the train
        from the hotel to go to Chinatown to shop.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Patrick: How long are you going to be there?</p>
    <p>Jane: Just three days.</p>
    <p>Patrick: You need to prepare your luggages carefully. Make sure you don&rsquo;t
        forget anything.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Jane: I know, I will!</p>
    <p>Patrick: What time will you check in?</p>
    <p>Jane: I have to check in at 8 am in the morning because the airplane is scheduled to
        take off at 2:00 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
