    <p><strong>Dean:</strong> What are your plans tomorrow?</p>
    <p><strong>Tim:</strong> I might go bowling tomorrow but my brother is asking me to play chess with him. So I still haven't decided.</p>
    <p><strong>Dean:</strong> I know how to play chess.</p>
    <p><strong>Tim:</strong> Chess requires strategy. I'm not good at playing chess. I'm not interested in strategic games.</p>
    <p><strong>Dean:</strong> What are you good at, then?</p>
    <p><strong>Tim:</strong> I'm good at bowling. I love singing too. How about you?</p>
    <p><strong>Dean:</strong> I'm good at sketching faces. I love painting too.</p>
    <p><strong>Tim:</strong> I want to learn how to paint. Can you teach me?</p>
    <p><strong>Dean:</strong> On Sunday, I'll be painting at my uncle's place. Want to go with me?</p>
    <p><strong>Tim:</strong> Sure!</p>
