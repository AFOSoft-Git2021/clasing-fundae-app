	<h3 class="ReferenciaInterna"> Dear diary,</h3>


	<p>I
		went to the well-known shopping center in the town. I saw a variety
		of items, it was surprising because they offer brand-new and
		second-hand items and I also saw some of the local products that were
		hand-made by the local people. Anyway, I was looking for a
		high-heeled shoe, because I’m going to use it in a party that will
		be held on friday.
	</p>

	

	</p>
	<p>I
		was wondering why the party was well-kept, maybe because there will
		be a lot of well-off guests and for sure they have body guards that
		wear a bullet-proof vest.
	</p>

	

	</p>
	<p>I
		think I need to find a good-looking escort to be with me for that
		night. They said that the party will be in a first-class hotel, I
		can’t wait for this! It's going to be exciting.</p>

	

	</p>
	<p>Yours,</p>
	<p>Anna.</p>
