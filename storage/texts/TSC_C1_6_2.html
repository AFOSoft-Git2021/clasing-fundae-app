	<p>Tristan:
		The weather does feel nice
		today. I do love summer.</p>
	<p>Rian:
		It sure does feel warm today. It does feel nice to wear shorts.</p>
	<p>Tristan:
		What&rsquo;s that over there? Are they selling lemonade? I do feel
		like drinking lemonade right now.</p>
	<p>Rian:
		They do sell lemonade. A cold drink sure does feel nice.</p>
	<p>Tristan:
		I didn&rsquo;t recognise the stall, but I did notice a stall selling
		burgers. The patties do smell good.</p>
	<p>Rian:
		I did see the stall earlier. Yes, it does look good. Do you love
		burgers?</p>
	<p>Tristan:
		I do love burgers. I do love cooking burgers, too.</p>
	<p>Rian:
		I do love eating. But I do hate cooking.</p>
