		Subject:
		RE: Landscaping and Maintenance</p>
	<p>
		Thank
		you for your inquiry about our services. Arbor Care is a green lawn
		care and landscaping business. We are anxious to only use
		environmentally friendly techniques and products when caring for the
		grounds of any business.</p>

	<p>
		We&rsquo;ve
		been working in the Portland area for over 20 years. Currently we
		have opened a branch in the downtown area due to a demand.
	</p>
	<p>
		As
		to your specific request, yes, we will be very conscious to easily
		remove dead trees.
	</p>

	<p>
		Due
		to your existing landscaping, we have to double check if it will fit.</p>
	<p>
		To
		give you an exact quote, we would need to stop by and assess the
		situation in person.
	</p>
	<p>
		To
		have one of our garden technicians stop by, please call US at (713)
		678-9916. Our website is currently down due to a technical error.</p>
	<p>
		We
		hope to hear from you soon.</p>
