		<i>Dear
			Willow,</i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>I
			wish I could have written this letter to you sooner. I&rsquo;ve been
			busy with the opening of my business. I could have known it was your
			birthday that day. </i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>I
			sent a package to your address, it is not much but a &lsquo;belated
			birthday gift&rsquo;, I guess. </i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>It
			is not a joke to open up a business. I could have studied more about
			it. I could have listened to my uncle, remember him, the owner of
			Trader&rsquo;s Hill.</i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>I
			was pushing to open immediately. I could have waited till the range
			hood in the kitchen was installed properly, I guess I was counting on
			how much I will lose from the rent. </i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>How
			was your course doing? Last I heard, You were applying for a sports
			scholarship. </i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>I
			could have witnessed how you tackled those guys in the field. </i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>I
			could have flown for two days, applying for the business permit is a
			pain in the neck. </i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>I
			can&rsquo;t imagine how people cheered for you. I could have been
			swaying in the middle of the field, shouting your name! </i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Still
			dating that straight A&rsquo;s student, Becky? Is that her name? </i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>I
			could have listened to all the rumors about you and her dating at the
			library, but that&rsquo;s none of my business. </i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>As
			soon as everything is settled here, I will be there the soonest. </i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>I
			still have your business advice on my mind. I couldn&rsquo;t have
			opened this business without your ideas. </i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>See
			you soon, </i>
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Brad
		</i>
	</p>
