	<p>Dear
		diary,</p>

	<p>I’m
		currently on the third day of my seven-day journey to fitness. I took
		a 30-minute run outside with my dog. I had to stop to take a
		10-minute call from my boss. He asked if I was interested in a
		position with six-digit pay.</p>

	<p>I’m
		still thinking about the position. It takes a ten-hour drive to get
		there. I might need to find a one-bedroom apartment first. It’d be
		weird for a 27-year-old guy to live in a huge house. One room is
		enough for me and my dog.</p>

	<p>I’m
		glad that I’ve been doing a 30-minute run the last two days. My
		boss told me they had to use the stairs to climb up and down from a
		40-story building. This seven-day journey to fitness will surely help
		with climbing the stairs.</p>

	<p>I
		might accept the offer for the position after I finish this seven-day
		project. I might need to refrain from watching my 30-minute show. I
		need all the time I have for the seven-day project.</p>

	<p>I’m
		planning to stay at a five-star hotel while I find a one-bedroom
		apartment. They say there’s a 50-meter pool at that hotel. I can’t
		wait to check that out. I also need someone who can give me a two-day
		tour so I can familiarize myself with the city.</p>

	<p>I
		will prepare the things I need after this project.So
			far, all I could think of was that I needed five 2-liter gas
			containers for the ten-hour drive.</p>



	<p>Yours,</p>
	<p>Andrew.</p>
