    <p><span>Dear diary,</span></p>
    
    <p><span>If I&#39;d known it was going to be this hot, I&#39;d have worn my shorts. Besides
            the weather, the traffic irritates me. I have never been this irritated.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>I saw my friend, and furthermore, I wasn&rsquo;t irritated anymore. She&rsquo;s a
            photographer and also writes books. She enjoys taking pictures and, moreover, is good at it.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>When she takes portrait pictures, the lighting is perfect, and what&rsquo;s more, the
            angle is great. In addition to her great pictures, she has written good books. Besides her talent, her
            personality makes her a great friend.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>I&rsquo;m tired, and I&rsquo;m also hungry. I&rsquo;ll order my food and take some
            rest.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Yours,</span></p>
    <p><span>Rob</span></p>
