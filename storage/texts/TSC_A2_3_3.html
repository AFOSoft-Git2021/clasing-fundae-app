    <p>
      Once upon a time, there was a boy named Alfred who decided to build a new
      tree house.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>He wanted his tree house to be high.</p>

    <p>
      He walked through his yard and picked up huge pieces of wood that he could
      find.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      He found some short and long woods and piled them all up near the oak
      tree.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>He figured he would also need nails and a hammer.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      He went to his father&rsquo;s workshop and found a hammer that was very
      old and dirty.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>He also saw some used nails.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      He was on his way to the yard when it started to rain. The floor is
      slippery to work now.
    </p>

    <p>Alfred started to walk very slow towards his house.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>When he got inside, he put on dry clothes.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      He sat down on his sofa and played a lovely song while he drank his hot
      tea&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>and thought about his tree house.</p>
