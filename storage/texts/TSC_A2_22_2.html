    <p>Sara: Hi, Liam! I&rsquo;m glad we have music class together. It&rsquo;s so
        cool.</p>
    <p>Liam: Are you excited? I&rsquo;m scared to sing the chorus of this song. As you know
        girls are so much better at singing!</p>

    <p>Sara: Come on, you can&rsquo;t be that bad. I&rsquo;m not a singer, either. But I
        play the piano!</p>
    <p>Liam: Do you want to have your own band in the future?</p>

    <p>Sara: No, not a chance. I just like to play for myself and in music class,
        too.</p>
    <p>Liam: I see. I think I want to learn to play the cello.</p>

    <p>Sara: It is such a pretty instrument. I adore the sound of the strings.</p>
    <p>Liam: Yes, me too.</p>

    <p>Sara: Another instrument with strings is the guitar. I wonder how hard it is to learn
        how to play the guitar.</p>
    <p>Liam: Me too. There are types of guitar. I know electric and acoustic guitar. Which
        one would you like to learn first?</p>

    <p>Sara: I am interested in learning the acoustic first.</p>

    <p>Liam: You need to write down all the chords.</p>
    <p>Sara: You are right. Do you know any artist that plays an acoustic
        guitar?</p>
