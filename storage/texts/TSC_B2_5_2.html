    <p><span>Dear diary,</span></p>
    
    <p><span>I went outside for a run. It is true that I get tired quickly. Personally, I think I
            can&rsquo;t be an athlete.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Actually, it was my dad&rsquo;s idea for me to run. It is true that I need to
            exercise regularly. Walking is enough exercise from my point of view. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, I am
            done with it.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>To tell the truth, I don&rsquo;t want to exercise regularly. Personally, I think
            it&rsquo;s not necessary. In fact, I feel better when I don&rsquo;t exercise regularly. But to be honest,
            that&rsquo;s a lie.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Sincerely,</span></p>
    <p><span>Cris</span></p>
