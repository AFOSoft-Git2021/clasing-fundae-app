    <p><span>Dear diary,</span></p>
    
    <p><span>I bought a new phone. It has all the same functions as my old phone. There are still
            more things I have to learn about this new phone. It functions well regardless of the low battery. Even so,
            I prefer my old phone.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>I also bought a new bike. It has all the same features as my old bike. It&#39;s not
            brand new, but it still runs faster than my old bike. Regardless of its age, it&rsquo;s in good condition.
            It&rsquo;s difficult to ride, but even so, it&rsquo;s quite good.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>The previous owner said the bike would suit me because I was small. I knew he had
            meant it kindly, but it had hurt all the same. Well, it&rsquo;s true. Regardless of the size, this bike fits
            me better.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Sincerely,</span></p>
    <p><span>Andy.</span></p>
