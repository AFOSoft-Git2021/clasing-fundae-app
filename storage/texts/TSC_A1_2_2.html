    <h2>Eiffel Tower</h2>
    <p>
      The Eiffel Tower is world famous. It gets millions of tourists every year.
      However, it is getting old. It is 133 years old. Engineers found it is
      full of rust. They said it was &quot;in a poor state&quot;. The tower
      needs many repairs. If it is not repaired, it might not be safe. Its
      designer, Gustave Eiffel, would be sad if he saw it today.

      The Eiffel Tower opened in 1889. It was built for the 1889 World&#39;s
      Fair in Paris. It contains 10,100 tons of iron. It was built just for 20
      years. The French government decided to keep it. The tower is being
      repainted for the 2024 Olympics. Engineers say new paint will not make the
      rust go away.
