	<p>Killer proved innocent</p>

	<p>The prosecution
		was not able to provide enough evidence, making it hard to prove the killer is guilty. On the other
		hand, the suspect was able to provide an alibi and prove that he was not armed on the night the killing
		happened.
	</p>

	<p>The suspect’s
		attorney was able to prove that the suspect is innocent and is a law-abiding citizen who is not capable
		of committing any illegal acts.
	</p>

	<p>The jury reached a unanimous verdict of not guilty. The said killer has not committed any
		offense and will not face a sentence.
	</p>

	<p>The trial ended
		yesterday. Protestors gathered outside the court. They were not happy with the verdict.</p>
