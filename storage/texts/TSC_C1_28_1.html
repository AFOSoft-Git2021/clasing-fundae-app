	<p>Dear
		Ms. Russell</p>

	<p>We
		received your email which you sent on Tuesday, December 4.</p>
	<p>What
		you are inquiring about is our wedding planning and event services.
	</p>
	<p>Specializing
		in all kinds of weddings is what we can provide you.
	</p>
	<p>Not
		only do we offer small, indoor or outdoor weddings, but we got
		various kinds of decorations tailored to your dream wedding.
	</p>
	<p>What
		we can offer may be the right package for you.</p>
	<p>A
		wedding package that is less than 5,000 dollars is what you wrote to
		us.
	</p>
	<p>A
		large venue close to a major highway is where you want it to be held.

	</p>
	<p>What
		we need to expect is many guests from all over the country.
	</p>
	<p>As
		I understand it, your other preferences are as follows:</p>

	<p>an outdoor venue
	</p>
	<p>a
		photographer and videographer available at all times for
		documentation
	</p>
	<p>decorations
		including colorful flowers and elegant tablecloths
	</p>

	<p>What
		I've attached here is a list of all our possible wedding packages
		that you might be interested in.
	</p>
	<p>They
		are all located within 15 minutes' drive of Highway 519. Please look
		through the provided information to decide which location fits your
		needs best.
	</p>
	<p>Once
		you have made a decision, this email is where you will inform me when
		you would like the wedding to be held.
	</p>
	<p>This
		will help me secure a reservation for you.</p>

	<p>Thanks,</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Kelly
