	<p>

		Stephanie,
		my bestie, did you see the flyer that has been hung on the bulletin
		board in the hallway? It says a yoga class can be enjoyed by all
		employees, you don&rsquo;t have to pay any bucks. You should have
		signed up.
	</p>

	<p>

		Yeah, I saw that. It looks like a great opportunity. Anyway, it is
		held on Wednesday nights and that&rsquo;s the same day as my jazz
		dance class.</p>

	<p>

		Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know you took a dance class. You should have
		performed on this year&rsquo;s year-end. Your talents are over the
		top, huh? I would love to see you dance sometime.</p>

	<p>

		Well, I&rsquo;m just a newbie in the jazz dance class. I would be so
		happy if you would come to one of our classes these days, I think a
		dance piece will be given to me.
