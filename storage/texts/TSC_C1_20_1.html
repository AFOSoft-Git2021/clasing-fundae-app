	<p>Dear
		Mr. Gail,</p>

	<p>Pleasing
		day to you. I hope this message will find you well.</p>
	<p>We
		would like to share with you the development of your son in the
		classroom.
	</p>
	<p>He
		hardly ever listens whenever we tell him to focus on his tasks.</p>
	<p>He
		will only try to acknowledge if we offer sweets or gifts.
	</p>
	<p>The
		Science teacher reported that they had an activity, he was nowhere to
		be found.</p>
	<p>We
		always try our best to understand him, we never lose patience.
	</p>
	<p>We
		are confident, you are only the right person to speak to him.
	</p>
	<p>In
		addition to the report, he hardly ever participates in group
		activities. We are hoping he&rsquo;ll be more engaging.
	</p>
	<p>We
		are only allowing him to bring one stuffed animal, so he won&rsquo;t
		lean into playing.
	</p>
	<p>Whenever
		the teacher scarcely enters the room, he wouldn&rsquo;t sit down but
		he would rather shout and run around.
	</p>
	<p>He
		also hardly finishes his meal when it is lunch time.
	</p>

	<p>We
		believe that every feedback leads to wonderful changes.
	</p>
	<p>Don&rsquo;t
		hesitate to arrange a meeting. I am only available after lunch from
		Mondays to Fridays.
	</p>

	<p>Sincerely,</p>
	<p>Matthew
		Connor</p>
	<p>Grade
		Eight Head Teacher
