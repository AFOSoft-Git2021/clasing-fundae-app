    <p>
      Lili:&nbsp;I was looking for you last night at the party. Where were you?
    </p>

    <p>Dana:&nbsp;I went home early as I felt ill.</p>

    <p>Lili:&nbsp;Oh, are you alright now?</p>

    <p>
      Dana:&nbsp;Yes, I am better. I feel as fine as the weather today.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Dana:&nbsp;You look like you haven&rsquo;t had sleep.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Lili:&nbsp;Not gonna lie. I feel like I am about to vomit. I drank a lot
      last night.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Dana:&nbsp;You have to drink something, like any medicine.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Lili:&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t stand medicines, like a medicine for
      nausea.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Dana:&nbsp;You are acting like a child right now. Just drink one.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Lili:&nbsp;You are like my dad, so eager to tell me what to do.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Dana:&nbsp;After taking the medicine, you can feel as better as you did
      before the party.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Lili:&nbsp;I need to see someone, like a doctor or something.&nbsp;</p>
