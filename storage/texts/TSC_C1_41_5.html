	<p> Man: Hey, Katrina! I’m going to pick you up at 5 o’clock to go to the rock festival. I had a blast last year.
		I hope it’s over the top with artists this year.</p>




	<p> Woman: Yeah, I’m excited too. I hope we won’t get that tipsy! However, are you sure if we leave at 5:00 we will
		till get there on time? It starts at 5:30 and I think it takes at least an hour to get there.</p>




	<p> Man: Totally! I was so wasted by the 3rd band. Huh? Isn’t it being held in Harpersville like last year?</p>




	<p> Woman: No, the festival is being held in Bristol this year. The festival organizers are expecting
		the venue to be loaded this year. They were concerned that there wouldn’t be enough parking spaces,
		so they moved it to Bristol.</p>
