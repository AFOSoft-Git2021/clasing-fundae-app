    <p><span>Nicole:</span><span>&nbsp;In addition to our project, this homework is
            tiring. I have never been this tired.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Rika:</span><span>&nbsp;We have to work on our group project and also do
            our homework. It&rsquo;s the final quarter, and furthermore, I&rsquo;m barely hanging on.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Nicole:</span><span>&nbsp;The project is hard, and what&rsquo;s more, our
            group mates aren&rsquo;t participating. They are lazy, and furthermore, they have no sense of
            responsibility.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Rika:</span><span>&nbsp;I never had group mates this lazy. In addition to
            their absence, their attitude is draining me.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Nicole:</span><span>&nbsp;By the way, I like your essay. It is
            well-written, and moreover, it&rsquo;s simple. Your essays have never been this good.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Rika: </span><span>Oh! Thanks a lot Nicole!</span></p>
