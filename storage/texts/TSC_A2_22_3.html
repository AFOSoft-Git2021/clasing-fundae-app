    <p>Betty: Listen! Somebody&rsquo;s playing Boogie wonderland.</p>

    <p>Frank: Which genre is that song?</p>

    <p>Betty: It is disco! What about you Frank, What kind of music do you enjoy listening
        to?</p>

    <p>Frank: Hmm. It depends. I like to listen to popular music when I am driving. Whenever
        I am studying, I play some country music. But, when I do exercise, Hiphop music is my jam!</p>

    <p>Betty: Interesting! Well, When I jog, electronic dance music is what I listen
        to!</p>

    <p>Frank: Have you tried breakdancing? It is incredible!</p>
    <p>Betty: I am a bad dancer. But, I can dance to the beat of the song.</p>

    <p>Frank: That&rsquo;s cool. Do you have a favorite artist?</p>

    <p>Betty: I do think Madonna is a great artist!</p>
    <p>Frank: Oh yeah, I heard about this album of hers, Like a prayer.</p>
