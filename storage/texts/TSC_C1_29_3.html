	<p>Dear
		Ms. Zimmerman,</p>
	<p>I
		recently read an article in the Madison Business Update about the
		openings at a new factory in Madison.
	</p>
	<p>As
		a former employee of Sun Microchips, I was really excited by the
		prospect of joining your company again.</p>
	<p>I
		am absolutely ready to embark into new challenges.
	</p>
	<p>Please
		see the attached file. I would really appreciate it if you would give
		me a chance to have an interview.
	</p>
	<p>Anytime
		on December 10 will totally work for me.
	</p>
	<p>If
		you would like to learn more about my past work experience with Sun
		Microchips, you may absolutely contact my former supervisor, Todd
		Smith. He is still working there.</p>

	<p>I
		look forward to meeting you.</p>
	<p>Jake
		Henry</p>
