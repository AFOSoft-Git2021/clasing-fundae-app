    <p>Dear diary,</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>By the end of the exam, I won't have slept for a night. If I study well, I will have passed the exams. By the end of this year, I will have completed my degree. Will I have applied for a job after that? Will I have done well in an interview?</p>
    <p>I will have finished my book before graduation. I'll have learned enough vocabulary to spice up my book. I will have published my book by the end of this year. I will have spent my savings on the publishing of my book. I will have saved enough money if I continue cooking my own meals.</p>
    <p>By tomorrow, I will have lived for 26 years. My family will have bought tickets to visit me. I will have cleaned the house before they come. I will have gone to the market by 6 o'clock. My family will have arrived by 10 o'clock.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Sincelery,</p>
    <p>Rob.</p>
