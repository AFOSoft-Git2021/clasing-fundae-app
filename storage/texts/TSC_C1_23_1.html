		<b>Questions: TSC-C1_23_1 until C1_23_15</b>
	</h3>


	<p>
		<b>Professor:</b>
		Tell us a moment or time in your life when people think something
		happened but didn&rsquo;t actually occur.
	</p>

	<p>
		Adam:
		I
		always think that this is creepy. One time my sister said she saw me
		having pancakes in the morning. I can&rsquo;t have been the one to
		eat since, I don&rsquo;t like pancakes.
	</p>

	<p>
		Bryan:
		My parents were mad at me one time because their car got scratches, I
		can&rsquo;t have driven it since I don&rsquo;t drive!
	</p>

	<p>
		Chris:
		There was gossip at school and they thought it was me. I can&rsquo;t
		have spread it since I am too shy to ask where the library is.
	</p>

	<p>
		Dina:
		I passed an English exam and my parents were astonished. I can&rsquo;t
		have copied answers, I was too far to my seatmate.
	</p>

	<p>
		Earl:
		I had a friend who says he saw me in Paris. I can&rsquo;t have been
		there since I don&rsquo;t even have a passport yet.
	</p>

	<p>
		Frank:
		I
		was at a party and there were these Italian circle of friends.
		Suddenly walked up to me and started speaking in Italian.
	</p>
	<p>
		I
		can&rsquo;t have replied to it, I don&rsquo;t speak Italian.
	</p>


	<p>
		Gio:
		They had this rumor about me bullying someone in our class. I can&rsquo;t
		have done it, I am too nice for those things.
	</p>


	<p>
		Hans:
		I had a professor who was asking for my thesis. I can&rsquo;t have
		finished it when he just gave the topic two days ago.
	</p>

	<p>
		Ian:
		I was watching a competition when they called my name. I can&rsquo;t
		have won, I did not even join.
	</p>

	<p>
		John:
		I went to a shopping center. I was on my way out of the shop, and the
		alarm rang. I can&rsquo;t have stolen anything, I can never do that.
	</p>

	<p>
		Kevin:
		It was also a creepy story. I used to work in an academy. A colleague
		of mine thought I went to the toilet. After a while, he saw me at the
		office. He was like &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have been sitting there, I
		saw you.&rdquo;
	</p>

	<p>
		Luis:
		I don&rsquo;t usually clean my room but one time I did. My mom was
		shocked. I can&rsquo;t have cleaned the house myself, she said I must
		have had some help.
	</p>

	<p>
		Mark:
		There was a time my number was sending out scam messages. I can&rsquo;t
		have done it, I don&rsquo;t have time for that nonsense.
	</p>

	<p>
		Nora:
		I
		passed a writing exercise and the teacher asked if I got it
		somewhere. I told her &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have copied someone&rsquo;s
		work, that was purely my ideas.&rdquo;</p>


	<p>
		Oscar:
		They used to say I was dating my best friend in middle school. I
		can&rsquo;t have dated her, she has a boyfriend already.
	</p>
