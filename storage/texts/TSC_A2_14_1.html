      Hi, My name is Amanda. I would like to tell you something about
      myself.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      I often go to the cinema with my family but I always watch movies at
      home.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a friend whose name is Maya. We usually take a walk at the
      park.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>We sometimes go to the gym if we are not busy.</p>

    <p>
      Maya rarely eats fast food because she always likes to eat fresh
      food.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>But I often order fast food, I like that we are both different.</p>

    <p>I always listen to music but Maya seldoms listens to music.</p>
    <p>
      Maya always dances when she hears music but I never dance to music.&nbsp;
