    <p>Dear diary,</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I have decided to move to another town. I have consulted my parents about it. They advised me to follow my dreams. I want to achieve my goals.</p>
    <p>I have examined the town that I want to move to. I have estimated the cost of living there. I got accepted for the job I applied for. I have prepared everything and will leave the next morning.</p>
    <p>I hope that my fresh start will be a success. Cheers to new beginnings!</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Yours,</p>
    <p>Joe.</p>
