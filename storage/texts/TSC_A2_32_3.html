    <p>What are the types of triangles in geometry?</p>
    <p>There are basically six types of triangles:</p>
    <p>Scalene Triangle</p>
    <p>Isosceles Triangle</p>
    <p>Equilateral Triangle</p>
    <p>Acute-angled triangle</p>
    <p>Obtuse-angled triangle</p>
    <p>Right-angled triangle</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equilateral
      Triangle: A triangle is considered to be an equilateral triangle when all
      three sides have the same length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isosceles triangle:
      When two sides of a triangle are equal or congruent, then it is called an
      isosceles triangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scalene triangle:
      When none of the sides of a triangle are equal, it is called a scalene
      triangle.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acute Triangle: When
      all the angles of a triangle are acute, that is, they measure less than
      90&deg;, it is called an acute-angled triangle or acute triangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right Triangle: When
      one of the angles of a triangle is 90&deg;, it is called a right-angled
      triangle or right triangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtuse Triangle:
      When one of the angles of a triangle is an obtuse angle, that is, it
      measures greater than 90&deg;, it is called an obtuse-angled triangle or
      obtuse triangle.
