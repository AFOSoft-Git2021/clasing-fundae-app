	<p> Man: This is Mike Judge, your host for the morning news here at QQBC 99.5. Today our guest is a big fish in
		the health and fitness business. Let’s welcome a leader, Karen Chambers.

	<p> She recently opened a chain of health food stores across the state. Did you pull a few strings to
		achieve this milestone, Ms. Chambers?</p>

	<p> Woman: Well, I majored in food and nutrition and I minored in business administration. </p>


	<p> So, my goal was to utilize what I learned in college. I had to follow my gut feeling. I have had a lot
		of cat naps to open a successful company.</p>


	<p> Man: Ah, I see. What factor do you think has contributed most to the success of your chain of
		stores?</p>

	<p> Woman: I think it’s due to the recent trend of people, they are all in the same boat in being fit
		and healthy.</p>
