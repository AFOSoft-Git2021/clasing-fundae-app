    <p>
      Jani: Welcome to the department, Yuki. Let me show you around and tell you
      about your new colleagues. I&#39;ll introduce you to them all later.
    </p>
    <p>Yuki: Great. Thanks. So, who are those people over there?</p>
    <p>
      Jani: That&#39;s the order management team. Luciana deals with the new
      orders. She&#39;s the one with short, dark hair.
    </p>
    <p>Yuki: In the purple dress?</p>
    <p>
      Jani: Yeah, that&#39;s right. You&#39;ll probably work closely with her
      while you are learning about our ordering process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yuki: Got it, thanks. And who&#39;s that over there? The guy who&#39;s on
      the phone?
    </p>
    <p>Jani: Oh, you mean the one by the window? In the green shirt?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ah, that&#39;s Ian. He&#39;s the marketing director.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      And that&#39;s Maria beside him. She&#39;s responsible for the internal IT
      systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yuki: OK, I&#39;ll try to remember all of this. I should probably be
      taking notes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Jani: Don&#39;t worry about it. For now it&#39;s just good to put some
      faces to names.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yuki: OK, great &ndash; and who do I talk to about setting up my mobile
      phone with email access? Is that also Maria?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jani: No, you need to talk to Sebastian who works in communications. He
      can help you. That&#39;s him over there, next to the printer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>Yuki: Thanks. I&#39;ll introduce myself to him later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
