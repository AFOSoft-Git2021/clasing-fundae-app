		Man:
		Hello, Ms. Turner. This is Michael Fox calling from the Yorkshire
		Seaside Hotel. One of our seaside rooms must have been rebooked.
	</p>
	<p>
		It
		says here that you should be contacted once a seaside room becomes
		available.</p>
	<p>
		If
		you would like to upgrade, you may now.</p>
	<p>
		Woman:
		Oh, great. My son&rsquo;s birthday party should be booked in a bigger
		room! Thanks so much for informing me.
	</p>

	<p>
		How
		much of a buck will I&rsquo;ll spending from my standard room?
	</p>
	<p>
		Man:
		Well, it will cost an extra $50 a night. However, the room comes with
		a larger bed and a hot tub. You should be given good grub for less
		than $10 a person.</p>
	<p>
		I
		recommend you visit our website for room availability that might have
		been refreshed by now.
	</p>
	<p>
		Woman:
		OK. I&rsquo;ll look at your website and then call you back with my
		decision.</p>
