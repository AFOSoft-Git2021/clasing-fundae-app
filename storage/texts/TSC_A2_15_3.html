    <p>Stef: I have been waiting here since 4 o&#39;clock.</p>
    <p>Sue: I am so sorry. I was waiting for the bus for 20 minutes.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Stef: I have been looking for a job for a week now. I haven&#39;t heard
      from any company yet. What about you?&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Sue: I know. I&rsquo;ve been passing my papers since Monday. I
      haven&rsquo;t gotten any calls either.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Stef: I have been trying to save money for years to buy a new car.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Sue: It is going to be hard to buy a new car&nbsp; since they raise all
      the prices.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Stef: I am planning to work at my uncle&rsquo;s company for a month while
      waiting for a job.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Sue: That&rsquo;s a good idea. I&rsquo;ve only been living here in this
      city for a year and everything is getting more expensive.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Stef: You are right. I stopped going to the gym for a month now.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Sue: I haven&rsquo;t been to the gym since February this year.</p>
