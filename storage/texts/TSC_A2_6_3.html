      One lovely evening, Ahmad and his Father went jogging at the park nearby
      their house.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Suddenly, Ahmad saw a man lying on the ground.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Ahmad stopped and shouted at his father to stop jogging. They carried the
      poor man to the side of the road.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>The man had breathing problems.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Ahmad quickly called an ambulance. While waiting, Ahmad&rsquo;s father did
      CPR to help with the man&rsquo;s breathing.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>The ambulance arrived after 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      He was sent to hospital immediately. Ahmad and his father continued
      jogging.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Ahmad&rsquo;s father praised him for his quick action.</p>

    <p>
      It was a meaningful day for them because they have done something
      good.&nbsp;
