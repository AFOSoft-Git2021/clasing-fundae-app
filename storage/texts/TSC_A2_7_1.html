    <p>Dear Diary,</p>

    <p>
      Last night, as I was sleeping, I had a crazy dream. I was walking down the
      street by myself at night.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      It was raining hard. Suddenly, I saw a man dressed in black. He was
      running fast.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      In his arms, he was holding a bag that he had stolen from an old
      woman.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>The man was carrying a baseball bat in his left hand.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>I was chasing the man for a very long time.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      When I tried to grab the bag, he started swinging the baseball bat but I
      pushed him to the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      I grabbed the bag from the man and took it back to the old woman.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      The woman was crying in fright, but when she saw me return her bag, she
      smiled and thanked me.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>The next thing I heard was my mom calling my name&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Alex, Wake up or you&rsquo;ll be late for school.&rdquo;</p>
