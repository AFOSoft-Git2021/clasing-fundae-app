    <p>Dear diary</p>

    <p>I wish to know more about the world. Life is so interesting!</p>

    <p>I wish to have more knowledge about the origin of life. I wish to understand the
        importance of the sun.</p>

    <p>The world is so vast. I wish to taste the flavour of every dish. I wish to feel the
        different textures of food in my mouth. I wish to be able to cook every cuisine known to man.</p>

    <p>The life I want sounds like it costs a lot of money. I wish to earn enough. But maybe
        I wish the world didn&#39;t have to use money. So the people would be free to do whatever they
        want.</p>

    <p>I don&rsquo;t wish for people to be lazy, though. I also don&rsquo;t wish for the
        world to be in chaos.</p>

    <p>I wish to live in a world where peace and happiness dominate. I wish to make a
        change. I wish to influence people to want change too.</p>

    <p>I wish to grow more as a person. I wish to stay optimistic about things. Last but not
        least, I wish to stay hungry for knowledge. But of course, too much of anything is bad, so I have to
        maintain balance.</p>

    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

    <p>Luca M.</p>
