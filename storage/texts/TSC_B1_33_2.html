    <p>Dear diary,</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I hadn't been feeling well this morning. I had been watching a movie in my room for two hours. I had been playing on my laptop for five hours. I hadn't been feeling productive for a while.</p>
    <p>I had been meeting my online friends. We had been singing our favorite songs for hours. We had been jumping when the drums started. We had been enjoying our time spent together via our laptops.</p>
    <p>How long had I been playing? I'd been thinking about it for a few days. Had I been sleeping in my room all afternoon?</p>
    <p>I had been helping my brother with his homework. I had been writing essays for him. We had been painting on a canvas. We had only pizza and had been eating pizza since the morning.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Yours,<br>Beth.</p>
