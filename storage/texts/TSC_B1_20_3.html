    <p>Kylie: Do you know Miguel?</p>
  
    <p>Joe: Yeah, he is an old friend of mine. We actually went
            to the same school.</p>
  
    <p>Kylie: Is that right? A cousin of mine works with him
            and asked about you.</p>
  
    <p>Joe: You should have seen his house. It&rsquo;s
            huge.</p>
  
    <p>Kylie: I don&rsquo;t really like huge houses. Atleast,
            ours has a garden.</p>
  
    <p>Joe: Well, the property is actually not his, I think,
            it&rsquo;s his mom&rsquo;s.</p>
  
    <p>Kylie: I think it is expensive to own a house here. We
            bought ours when it was pandemic.</p>
  
    <p>Joe: Exactly. I am planning to extend my room. Your
            room&#39;s huge compared to mine.</p>
  
    <p>Kylie: Well, your ceiling is better than mine. I like
            its designs.</p>
  
    <p>Joe: We can call the architect again if you want the
            same ceiling as mine. </p>
