	<p> Man: Hello, this is Axel Fischer calling. I placed an order last week for a blouse that I was
		going to give to my wife as a present. However, I feel like such a lemon for buying the wrong size.
		I’d like to cancel the order.</p>



	<p> Woman: I hope that you are not pulling our legs here but that item was already shipped. </p>


	<p> You’ll have to wait until it arrives and then return it. But don’t worry. We can still refund your
		purchase.</p>


	<p> Man: Don’t worry, this isn’t a trick and I am not tipsy. I’m surprised it was shipped so soon
		after the order was placed. By the way, will I have to pay any bucks for shipping?</p>


	<p> Woman: Unfortunately, yes. According to our policy, in this case you will have to pay for the return shipping.
		I’ll send you a return shipping label via email in a jiffy. What’s your email address again?</p>
