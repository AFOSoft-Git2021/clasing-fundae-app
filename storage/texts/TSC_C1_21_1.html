	<p>Dear
		Mr. Turner,</p>

	<p>I
		hope this email finds you well.</p>

	<p>This
		is in regards to last night&rsquo;s incident, I apologize for the
		noise we&rsquo;ve caused in the apartment.
	</p>

	<p>I
		might have forgotten the rules and went overboard.
	</p>

	<p>We
		may have drunk a lot with our friends.
	</p>

	<p>I&rsquo;ll
		be willing to pay any fees to make up for our action. I may have told
		you last week, I will be giving another check in advance, let me know
		if I should add any additional fees.
	</p>

	<p>I
		would also take this opportunity to let you know I am planning to
		renovate my kitchen counter.
	</p>
	<p>I
		might have left the building permit two days ago in your mailbox.
	</p>
	<p>Kindly
		check if I have paid my garbage fees on time, I might have forgotten
		if I did.
	</p>

	<p>Thank
		you for understanding. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
	</p>


	<p>Sincerely,</p>
	<p>Matt
		Davis</p>
