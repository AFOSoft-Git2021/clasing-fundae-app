		<i>Dear Diary,</i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Today is a
			terrible day. I lost my money. </i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>I shouldn't have
			overlooked where I put my money. I should have devoured it on food.</i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>My friend
			transferred to a different school. I ought to have sung our favorite
			song before she left. I&rsquo;ll always treasure our memories. But we
			should have more moments to spend together. </i>
	</p>


	<p>
		<i>We had a
			surprise exam today. I should have reviewed our last lesson. At the
			same time, today was the submission of our assignment. I shouldn't
			have ignored doing my homework. </i>
	</p>


	<p>
		<i>I didn&rsquo;t
			have the energy to listen to the discussion. I should have rested
			more. I was late for the first time. I shouldn't have stayed up late
			last night, watching that recent series.</i>
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>I saw a guitar
			that was on sale on the way home. I should have found my cash soon.
			Today is not the best. I should have made more reasonable decisions.
			But that&rsquo;s life; today might not be great, but who knows what
			tomorrow brings?</i>
	</p>


	<p>
		<i>Sincerely as
			always,</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Seth </i>
