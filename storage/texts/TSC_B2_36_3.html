    <p><span>Ending Poverty</span></p>
    
    <p><span>What is Poverty?</span></p>
    <p><span>Poverty involves more than the lack of income and productive resources to ensure
            sustainable livelihoods.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>The first illustrations include hunger and malnutrition, the second is limited access
            to education and other basic services, social discrimination and exclusion, as well as the lack of
            participation in decision-making.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>In 2015, more than 736 million people lived below the international poverty
            line.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>Around 10 percent of the world population (pre-pandemic) was living in extreme
            poverty and struggling to fulfill the most basic needs like health, education, and access to water and
            sanitation, to name a few.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>There were 122 women aged 25 to 34 living in poverty for every 100 men of the same
            age group, and more than 160 million children were at risk of continuing to live in extreme poverty by
            2030.</span></p>
    <p><span>Ending poverty in all its forms is the first of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals
            of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</span></p>
    <p><span>The SDGs&rsquo; main reference to combating poverty is made in target
            1.A:&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>-Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including
            through enhanced development cooperation.</span></p>
    <p><span>The SDGs also aim to create sound policy frameworks</span><span
            >&nbsp;</span><span>at national and regional levels, based on pro-poor and
            gender-sensitive development strategies</span><span >&nbsp;</span><span>to ensure that
            by 2030 all men and women have equal rights to economic resources.</span></p>
