    <h2>The Heart</h2>
    <p>
      The heart is part of your body. The heart is slightly to the left of the
      center of your chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart makes the blood move through your body. If you press your ear
      against someone&rsquo;s chest you can hear the heart beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart is very important. To keep it healthy and strong, it is good to
      eat right and exercise. The heart is also a well-known symbol for love. It
      is pictured on love letters and valentines.
