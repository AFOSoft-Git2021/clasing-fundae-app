    <p>My name is Lili.</p>
   
    <p>I will compete in a swimming competition this weekend.</p>
   
    <p>I will wake up early in the morning all week to practice
            because I want to win the tournament.</p>
   
    <p>My trainer will help me in my practice.</p>
   
    <p>The winner will receive money and travel prizes.</p>
   
    <p>If I win, I am going to take my family for our first vacation.</p>
   
    <p>Also, I am going to buy a new bicycle too.</p>
   
    <p>My father and my sister will drive to go to my tournament.</p>
   
    <p>My mother won&#39;t come to the tournament because she will be at work.
    </p>
   
    <p>I am going to do my best to make her proud.</p>
   
    <p>I will bring home the prize! </p>
