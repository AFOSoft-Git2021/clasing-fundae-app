    <p><span>Technology today is evolving at a rapid pace, enabling faster change and progress,
            causing an acceleration of the rate of change.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>These are technologies we should watch out for.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>1. Computing Power</span></p>
    <p><span>From data science to robotics and IT management, this field will power the largest
            percentage of employment in every country.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>2. Smarter Devices&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>Artificial intelligence has played an essential role in making our world smarter and
            smoother. It is not just simulating humans but going the extra mile to make our life hassle-free and
            simpler.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>3. Datafication&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>Datafication is simply transforming everything in our life into devices or software
            powered by data. So, in short, Datafication is the modification of human chores and tasks into data-driven
            technology.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>4. Machine Learning</span></p>
    <p><span>Machine Learning is also being deployed in all kinds of industries, creating a huge
            demand for skilled professionals.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>5. Extended Reality&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>Extended Reality technology is massively popular amongst gamers, medical specialists,
            and retail and modeling.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>6. Digital Trust&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>To create a safer space for digital users, cybersecurity and ethical hacking are the
            major specializations you can check out.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>7. 3D Printing&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>A key trend in innovation and technology is 3D printing which is used to formulate
            prototypes. This technology has been impactful in the biomedical and industrial sectors.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>8. Genomics&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>It is a technology that can study your DNA and use it to improve your health,
            helping you fight diseases and whatnot!&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    
    <p><span>9. New Energy Solutions</span></p>
    <p><span>The world has agreed to be greener for the sake of its landscapes and the energy we
            use. This results in cars running on electricity or battery and houses using greener choices like solar and
            renewable energy.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>10. Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</span></p>
    <p><span>RPA is the use of software to automate business processes such as interpreting
            applications, processing transactions, dealing with data, and even replying to emails.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>RPA automates repetitive tasks that people used to do.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>11. Edge Computing</span></p>
    <p><span>Edge computing can be used to process time-sensitive data in remote locations with
            limited or no connectivity to a centralized location.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>12. Quantum Computing</span></p>
    <p><span>This amazing technology trend is also involved in preventing the spread of the
            coronavirus, and to develop potential vaccines, thanks to its ability to easily query, monitor, analyze and
            act on data, regardless of the source.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>13. Virtual Reality&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span>Although this technology trend has primarily been used for gaming thus far, it has
            also been used to train U.S. Navy, Army and Coast Guard ship captains.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>14. Blockchain</span></p>
    <p><span>Blockchains are consensus-driven, so no one entity can take control of the data.
            Although most people think of blockchain technology in relation to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin,
            blockchain offers security that is useful in many other ways.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>15. Internet of Things (IoT)</span></p>
    <p><span>Another promising new technology trend is IoT. Many &ldquo;things&rdquo; are now
            being built with WiFi connectivity, meaning they can be connected to the Internet&mdash;and to each
            other.</span></p>
