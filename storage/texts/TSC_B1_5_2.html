    <p>Jeff:&nbsp;Would you prefer to live in the country instead of a town?</p>

    <p>
      Becky:&nbsp;I prefer to live in the country because I don&rsquo;t like
      busy streets.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Jeff:&nbsp;That&rsquo;s good for you. I couldn&rsquo;t decide where I
      wanted to live more.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Becky:&nbsp;I heard you plan to move to a city soon.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>

      apartment. I can&rsquo;t afford to pay more than my salary.&nbsp;

    <p>
      Becky:&nbsp; You are right, My mom advised looking for another job in that
      case.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Jeff:<&nbsp;I will give what you said some thought.</p>

    <p>Becky:&nbsp;Or&hellip; I advise saving a little money every month.</p>

    <p>Jeff:<&nbsp;I actually began studying finance.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Becky:<&nbsp;That&rsquo;s really a good move, Jeff.</p>

    <p>
      Jeff:&nbsp;I want to consider which part of my finances I should work on.
    </p>

    <p>Becky:<&nbsp;I imagine joining your class one day.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Jeff:&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t understand why you want to join.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Becky:<&nbsp;I want to learn something new.&nbsp;</p>
