    <p>Dear diary,</p>

    <p>There&rsquo;s going to be a big event next week. I wish my mom would let me go
        there.</p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s a big event, so there are a lot of unfamiliar faces. I wish my friends
        would go with me.</p>

    <p>I wish I would be able to buy a new dress. I wish the dress would be how I want it. I
        wish the dress would be made of cotton.</p>

    <p>I wish I would be able to make friends there. Sometimes I&rsquo;m confident and
        sometimes I&rsquo;m not. I wish my insecurities wouldn&rsquo;t get in the way.</p>

    <p>I hope my dad has a day off. I wish he would fix my hair. He handles hair
        well.</p>
    <p>He has an old but cool car. I wish he would pick me up after the event.</p>

    <p>I get comfortable when my best friend is around. I wish he would go. It&rsquo;s going
        to be my best day if he&rsquo;s there.</p>


    <p>Good night,</p>
    <p>Anna.</p>
