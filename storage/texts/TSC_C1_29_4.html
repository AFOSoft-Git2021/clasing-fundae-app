	</h3>

	<p>November
		15—Sun Microchips is indeed the largest producer in the country of
		the integrated circuits that go into computers, smartphones, and
		other digital electronics.


	</p>
	<p>The
		company has recently built a new factory in Madison and will
		definitely begin operations starting in January of next year.


	</p>

	<p>The
		chief executive officer of Sun Microchips, Melinda Piers, stated
		that, “As the market for consumer electronics continues to simply
		become larger and larger globally, companies like Sun Microchips are
		expanding to meet the needs.&quot;


	</p>

	<p>&quot;We
		are completely hiring a variety of people such as factory workers,
		personnel employees, and accountants. We fully expect that the
		opening of the factory will create over 200 jobs in Madison,” said
		Ms. Piers. She noted that the company will certainly try to hire
		local applicants first, but that those living outside of Madison are
		also encouraged to apply.


	</p>
	<p>Applicants
		must thoroughly submit their resume by November 25 by emailing Tina
		Zimmerman at tzimmerman@sunmicrochips.com. Sun Microchips will
		undoubtedly be holding interviews next month on two separate dates.


	</p>
	<p>Those
		applying as general laborers for jobs on the assembly line should
		simply schedule an interview between December 3 and 8.


	</p>
	<p>Those
		interested in positions in personnel, accounting, and customer
		service are required to directly schedule an interview between
		December 9 and 11.
