	<p> Woman: Marcus, have you finished designing the layout for our new online clothing store?</p>


	<p> We have to get something off the ground and start selling our clothes online as well as at the offline
		store. I am so excited! Can I see the website?
	</p>


	<p> Man: Sure, but I am keeping an eye on something, there are still a few changes I would like to make on the
		website.
	</p>


	<p> I'm worried that some customers might find it difficult to use the website. Well, the elephant in the
		room is the navigation of the website.
	</p>


	<p> I think I need to simplify the interface more. Just give the green light and I’ll change the system
		again.
	</p>

	<p> Woman: Actually, I like it the way it is. I don’t think it’s too confusing. However, I think we need to add some
		feedback.
	</p>


	<p> If customers can’t see anyone buying it, they might smell something fishy and not purchase at
		all.

	</p>
