		Business Contract</p>

	<p>Dear
		Mr. Smith,</p>
	<p>I
		am Sharron Biggs, CEO and founder of BiggsGraphics.
	</p>
	<p>I
		have been coming across your advertisement seeking partnership with a
		graphic design company for a number of your projects.
	</p>

	<p>Fortunately,
		BiggsGraphics has extensive experience working with various small
		businesses and companies in designing advertising campaigns, logos,
		and websites.
	</p>

	<p>There
		have been decreasing projects for big companies recently. But we are
		still in business.
	</p>

	<p>Thankfully,
		we have been adding a lot of skilled and well-experienced employees
		in our team lately.
	</p>

	<p>I
		have attached a number of our past designs to illustrate what we have
		been specializing for.
	</p>

	<p>Our
		website www.biggs-graphics.com also has some information about our
		company.</p>
	<p>My
		team and I have been reading a lot about your company and hope we can
		have a project soon.
	</p>
	<p>I
		look forward to your reply.</p>
	<p>Sincerely,
		Sharron Biggs</p>
	<p>CEO,
		BiggsGraphics</p>
