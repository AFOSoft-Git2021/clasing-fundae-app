		<b>Questions: TSC-C1_11_21 until C1_11_25</b>
	</h3>

	<p>To:
		Our valued customers</p>
	<p>From:
		Larson&rsquo;s China</p>

	<p>Thank
		you for all the years you have been shopping at Larson&rsquo;s China.

	</p>

	<p>Our
		products are known to have been selling modern and unique patterns.
		Also, they are naturally made to last.
	</p>

	<p>Unfortunately,
		if the products have been holding in a rough way, it will result in
		eventual breakage.
	</p>

	<p>We
		have been suggesting that you store them carefully.</p>

	<p>We
		also have been sending reminders that you don&rsquo;t use harsh
		chemicals.</p>

	<p>Presumably,
		they will be looking brand new. Also, avoid scrubbing aggressively.
	</p>

	<p>Undoubtedly,
		you may visit our website at www.larsonchina.com for information
		about handling and care.</p>
