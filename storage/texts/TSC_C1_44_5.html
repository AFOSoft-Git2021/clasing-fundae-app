      <b>Questions: TSC-C1_44_26 until C1_44_30</b>
    </h3>

    <p>Hi, thanks for coming for this special meeting today.</p>

    <p>
      The reason I called everyone is to announce our new partnership with
      Walker Studios.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the CEO of Metro Studios, it is my great pleasure to witness this
      amazing opportunity to work with such a high caliber company like Walker
      Studios.
    </p>

    <p>
      As B2B , They possess a number of studios that are capable of producing
      cutting edge quality 3-D films.
    </p>

    <p>This will allow our company to add 3-D films to our SOW.</p>

    <p>
      The majority of our films are science fiction, and at the EOD I believe a
      transition into 3-D is an excellent path for us.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have ensured that we will have full access to Walker Studio’s equipment,
      and in return they will become a shareholder in our company.
    </p>

    <p>
      IMO, I suggest that our studio staff should spend the next following weeks
      studying how this new type of equipment works, so we can begin producing
      content as soon as possible.
    </p>
