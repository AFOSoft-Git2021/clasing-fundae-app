    <p>Dear diary,</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Yesterday, I went to the tournament to cheer on my friends. Their coach was fierce while he told them what tactics to use on the opponent.</p>
    <p>Our school defeated the other schools. Our school is the champion. My friend received a lot of awards. There were a lot of spectators yesterday. I was so stoked when they showed sportsmanship. They shook hands with the competitor.</p>
    <p>I wish the event would last longer. Watching my friends play on the court lights a fire inside me. It makes me wish I was an athlete too. I hope someday I get the chance to compete with other schools too. I want to be able to play on the court too. I want to win a championship cup.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Yours,</p>
    <p>Karen.</p>
