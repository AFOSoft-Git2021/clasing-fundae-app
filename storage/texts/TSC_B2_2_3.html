    <p><span>Eli:</span><span>&nbsp;Do you know what happened here a long time ago?</span></p>
    <p><span>Angelo:</span><span >&nbsp;This apartment was formerly a bakeshop. My dad used to work here in the old days. They baked as people did in ancient times.</span></p>
    <p><span>Eli:</span><span >&nbsp;Wow! That&rsquo;s cool.</span></p>
    <p><span>Angelo:</span><span >&nbsp;In the old days, they were the only bakeries around. The owner went bankrupt not long ago. He was forced to sell his property.</span></p>
    <p><span>Eli:</span><span >&nbsp;How about your dad? What happened to him?</span></p>
    <p><span>Angelo:</span><span >&nbsp;He opened his own bakeshop not long ago. Now he bakes as he did in the old days.</span></p>
    <p><span>Eli:</span><span >&nbsp;I&rsquo;m curious how people baked in ancient times.</span></p>
    <p><span>Angelo:</span><span >&nbsp;I&rsquo;m amazed how something is preserved from a long time ago.</span></p>
