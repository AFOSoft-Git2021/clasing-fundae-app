    <p>Ken: Have you heard? Our favorite band has released a
        new album. I wish I hadn&rsquo;t spent my money.</p>

    <p>Jay: Oh really? I wish they had told us that they would
        release a new album.</p>

    <p>Ken: Yeah, I wish I hadn&rsquo;t spent my money on
        shirts.</p>

    <p>Jay: I wish I had saved up some money.</p>

    <p>Ken: Do you know a shop that&rsquo;s hiring? I wish I
        had applied at my uncle&rsquo;s shop.</p>

    <p>Jay: There are not a lot of shops that are hiring right
        now. I wish I had made my resume and applied when I had the chance.</p>

    <p>Ken: I&rsquo;m tired of walking. I wish I had brought my
        bike.</p>

    <p>Jay: I&rsquo;m tired and thirsty. I wish I had bought
        water before walking home.</p>

    <p>Ken: We wouldn&rsquo;t be walking if the train
        hadn&rsquo;t left. I wish the train hadn&rsquo;t left.</p>

    <p>Jay: I wish you had brought your dad with us so he could
        drop us home.</p>

    <p>Ken: It&rsquo;s already too late. Let&rsquo;s just walk
        home peacefully.</p>
