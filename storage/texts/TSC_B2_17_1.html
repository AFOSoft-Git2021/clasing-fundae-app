    <p>Keilin: Finally! Dismissal. School is boring.</p>

    <p>Yorko: How so? Going to school is exciting.</p>

    <p>Keilin: Listening to teachers is tiring for me. Waking
        up early in the morning is depressing.</p>

    <p>Yorko: Our frightening future is ahead. You
        shouldn&rsquo;t be stagnant, try to have a caring personality.</p>

    <p>Keilin: Your eye-opening words really help me. It made
        me realise that my behaviour is damaging my future.</p>

    <p>Yorko: No worries, I&rsquo;m just trying to be a loving
        friend.</p>

    <p>Keilin: Thanks for sticking around, even if I&rsquo;m an
        exhausting friend.</p>

    <p>Yorko: I&rsquo;m not going to lie, sometimes
        you&rsquo;re annoying.</p>

    <p>Keilin: Ha ha ha ha ha ha</p>

    <p>Yorko: You have an annoying laugh.</p>

    <p>Keilin: I&rsquo;m thankful that I have you as a friend.
        I think you&rsquo;ll be a part of my raging success.</p>

    <p>Yorko: You should be thankful, being your friend is a
        thrilling task.</p>

    <p>Keilin: You&rsquo;re irritating when you describe our
        friendship like that.</p>
