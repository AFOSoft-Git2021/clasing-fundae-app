    <p>The crook and the bad machine</p>

    <p>Once upon a time there was a very evil and unpleasant crook (A person who is dishonest or criminal) who only ever
        thought
        about how to get money. Seeing anyone happy bothered the crook enormously.</p>

    <p>What he hated most was when people were polite and courteous to each other, saying
        things like please and thank you, and didn&#39;t mention it. It annoyed him even more if they were smiling
        when they said these things.</p>

    <p>The crook thought all those kinds of words were a useless waste, and weren&#39;t good
        for anything. So what he did was spend a lot of time inventing a machine which could steal words. With this
        machine, he planned to steal &#39;please&#39;, &#39;thank you&#39;, &#39;don&#39;t mention it&#39;, and
        similar words people used to be polite.</p>

    <p>He was convinced that no one would notice if those words were to suddenly disappear.
        When he had stolen these words, he intended to take them apart and sell the letters to book
        publishers.</p>

    <p>After he started up his machine, people would open their mouths, intending to say
        kind and polite things, but nothing came out. All those words ended up inside the big machine. Just as the
        crook had hoped, in the beginning nothing happened.</p>

    <p>It looked like people really didn&#39;t need to be polite after all.</p>
    <p>However, after a while, people started to feel like they were always in a bad mood,
        doing everything reluctantly, and feeling like everyone else was forever demanding of them.</p>

    <p>So, within a few days, everyone was angry and arguing over the slightest little
        thing.</p>
