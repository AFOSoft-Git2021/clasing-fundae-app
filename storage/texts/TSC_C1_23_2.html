		<b>Questions: TSC-C1_23_16 until C1_23_30</b>
	</h3>

	<p>
		<b>Professor:</b>
		What is your takeaway from today's discourse?
	</p>

	<p>
		Ali:

		He can't have been lying to the police, his excuse is valid.
	</p>

	<p>
		Britt:
		They
		can't have seen the foster parents since at the beginning it
		mentioned they were in London.
	</p>

	<p>
		Claire:
		They can&rsquo;t have finished the case since there were missing
		items.
	</p>

	<p>
		Dave:
		The
		prisoner can&rsquo;t have escaped through that window because it is
		too small.</p>

	<p>
		Eric:
		The kid can&rsquo;t have been at the movie theater. He was at home
		all weekend waiting for his foster parents.
	</p>


	<p>
		France:
		I
		don't think the prisoner can&rsquo;t have stated that. He is under
		the influence of drugs.
	</p>

	<p>
		Gab:
		Billy can't have driven there. His car keys were with the police.
	</p>
	<p>
		Hank:
		They can&rsquo;t have forgotten about the charges. I am guessing it
		is because of power and money.
	</p>

	<p>
		Iris:
		Bryan can&rsquo;t have committed the crime as he was in another
		country at the moment of the murder.
	</p>

	<p>
		Joy:
		The child can&rsquo;t have been at the scene. He was waiting for his
		brother to show up.
	</p>

	<p>
		Kat:
		He&rsquo;s been limping since this past week; he can&rsquo;t have
		been the suspect.
	</p>

	<p>
		Lira:

		I don't think the inmate can&rsquo;t have expressed that. He is under
		the effect of medication.
	</p>

	<p>
		Maya:
		Their car is still in the garage. The foster parents can&rsquo;t have
		been outside at the time of crime.</p>

	<p>
		Neri:
		They
		can&rsquo;t have concluded the lawsuit since there was incomplete
		evidence.</p>

	<p>
		Patt:
		The
		foster parents can't have been lying to the police, their excuse is
		valid.</p>
