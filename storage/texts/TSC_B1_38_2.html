    <p>Dear diary,</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I'm so tired today. I was dancing the whole day. I feel alive when I dance.</p>
    <p>My sister is singing when I enter her room. I asked her why she was singing. She told me she was in a good mood because she beat her friend at chess.</p>
    <p>I'm reading in my room. It's a book about baking. My mom loves baking. I watch how passionate she is when she bakes.</p>
    <p>My dad loves fishing. Tomorrow, me and my dad will go fishing at a nearby lake. I don't have the patience for fishing but watching my dad fish makes me happy too.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Kate.</p>
