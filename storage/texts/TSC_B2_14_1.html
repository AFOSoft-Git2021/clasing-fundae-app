    <p>Steff: Oh no, it&rsquo;s raining. I wish I had brought
        my umbrella.</p>

    <p>Mat: My shoes are going to get wet. I wish it
        hadn&rsquo;t rained.</p>

    <p>Steff: Wait, I&#39;ll call my brother and ask him to
        come pick us up. He&rsquo;s not answering; I wish I hadn&rsquo;t shouted at him earlier.</p>

    <p>Mat: I wish I hadn&rsquo;t
        forgotten what Mr. Logan told us to do when it rains.</p>

    <p>Steff: It&rsquo;s getting cold. I wish I had worn a
        jacket.</p>

    <p>Mat: I&rsquo;m still worried about my shoes. I wish I
        hadn&#39;t worn this.</p>

    <p>Steff: It will be alright. I wish my brother had read my
        message.</p>

    <p>Mat: I need to go to the restroom. I wish I hadn&rsquo;t
        drunk so much.</p>

    <p>Steff: Jack has a car; I wish we had brought him with
        us.</p>

    <p>Mat: We chose the wrong day to go out. I wish we
        hadn&rsquo;t gone here.</p>
