    <p>Dear diary,</p>

    <p>
      I received a greeting card. It includes an invitation to a family
      gathering. I want to hang out with my cousins. I&rsquo;m so excited to
      enjoy my visit there.
    </p>

    <p>
      My brother wants to avoid them. I hope I have what it takes to encourage
      him to go. I used to hate my cousins before. I&rsquo;m glad we mended our
      relationship.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want my brother to drop his pride. I want him and my cousins to solve
      their issues. I don&rsquo;t want this quarrel to breed hate.
    </p>

    <p>
      If I ever convince my brother to go, I have to monitor him at the family
      gathering. If he ever gets reckless. I have to apologize for his
      outrageous behavior to avoid further conflict.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Yours,</p>
    <p>Richard.</p>
