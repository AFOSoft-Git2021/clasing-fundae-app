	<p>Subject:
		Lecture Series</p>
	<p>Date:
		January 24</p>

	<p>Dear
		Ms. Flores,</p>

	<p>I
		work for Facilities Management here at Wurnster University. It was
		recently brought to my attention that there might have been a
		scheduling conflict concerning one of your lecture dates.
	</p>

	<p>You
		might have forgotten the reservation you made for Room 305.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately,
		it has been reserved for every Wednesday this semester by the
		Wurnster Debate Club.
	</p>
	<p>You
		might have left with a decision to change the room or dates.
	</p>

	<p>We
		may have written sooner but your email was inactive.
	</p>

	<p>We
		apologize for this. It might have been a glitch in the system.
	</p>

	<p>You
		can visit the facilities management website in order to check the
		availability of other room locations and reschedule the talk.</p>

	<p>Hoping
		for your understanding,
	</p>

	<p>Jake
		Patterson</p>
