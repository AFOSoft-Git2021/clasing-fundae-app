    <p>
      Tom: This test is difficult. I didn&rsquo;t know the answers to some
      questions.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ian: I had a hard time answering those questions at the back of the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom: That first part of the test is fun because it was just drawing
      something.
    </p>
    <p>Ian: I know we could have studied harder.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      Tom: Is that marker yours? I think you left it on top of the
      teacher&rsquo;s table.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>Ian: Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s mine.</p>
    <p>Ian: This book will help us study better for the next test.&nbsp;</p>
