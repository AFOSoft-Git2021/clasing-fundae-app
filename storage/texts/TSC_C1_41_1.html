			<p>Man: Hi, I need this suit cleaned. I’m going overseas to have a blast with friends and all my
					suits are getting a bit old now. How much would it cost to clean this?</p>
		
	
		
			<p>Worker:Hmm... Usually twenty dollars. But this one will cost a bit more.</p>
		
		
			<p>Man: Really? That’s over the top. On your price list, it says twenty dollars.</p>
		
		
			<p>Worker:Well, yes, but you’re very tall. This suit is going to take longer to clean since it has thicker fabrics
					which is not adoddle
					thing to do.</p>
		
		
			<p>It requires more products. It will incur an additional surcharge.</p>
		
	
			<p>Man: Hmm... Maybe I will take it somewhere else. I won’t spend more than twenty bucks.</p>
		
			<p>Worker:OK. You are pulling my leg over her but fine I will do it for twenty dollars. And whenever you need a
					suit cleaned, please come back to me.
