	<p>
		Dave:
		My mother always gets a little anxious if we don't arrive when we say
		we will.</p>
	<p>
		Alex:
		Are you sure? I've never seen her worried or anxious in any way -
		she's so laid-back.</p>
	<p>
		Dave:
		You
		haven&rsquo;t witnessed it yet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Alex:
		Will you be able to come with me at the party tonight, it is due at
		8 pm?
	</p>
	<p>
		Dave:
		I&rsquo;ll speak to my mom once we get home.
	</p>
	<p>
		Alex:
		I
		think she's very conscious of your actions whenever you go outside.
	</p>
	<p>
		Dave:
		I guess, it is her way of protecting me.</p>
	<p>
		Alex:
		I can totally see that. My mom is tired of asking me due to the fact
		that she knows I am stubborn enough.
	</p>
