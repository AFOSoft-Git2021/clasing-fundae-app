    <p>Dear diary,&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Andy has compelling eyes. His voice is so calming. He has an interesting
      personality.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      He had a very entertaining performance when he sang his songs in our
      class. His loving brother also joined his performance.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Even though there were some disappointing performances. The event was
      still a roaring success.
    </p>
    <p>
      My face is so irritating. It&rsquo;s so boring. I want to have a charming
      personality. I wish I didn&rsquo;t have a frightening aura.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tomorrow is exciting. It&rsquo;s the final day of the event. Will there be
      amusing artists? Will there be astonishing performances?
    </p>

    <p>I have to go to bed early. Waking up early is a challenging task.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>

    <p>Lisa.</p>
