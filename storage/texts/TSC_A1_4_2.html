    <h2>How much is a million?</h2>

    <p>
      If one million kids climbed onto one another&rsquo;s shoulder, they would
      be taller than the tallest building, higher than the highest mountains,
      and father up than airplanes can fly. If you wanted to count from one to
      one million, it would take you about 23 days. If a goldfish bowl were big
      enough for a million goldfish, it would be large enough to hold a whale.
      Presto! One hundred stars. If this book had a million tiny stars, they
      would fill seventy pages. Climb
      aboard!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      They have one hundred thousand stars, if we take this seven page journey
      ten times, we will pass a million stars. Hmm, let&rsquo;s do it later.
      I&rsquo;m thirsty. How big is one billion? If one billion kids made a
      human tower, they would stand up past the moon. If you sat down to count
      from one to one billion, you would be counting for 95 years. If you found
      a goldfish bowl large enough to hold one billion goldfish, it would be as
      big as a stadium.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this book had a billion tiny stars, its pages spread side by side would
      stretch almost thirty miles.

    <p>
      How tremendous is a trillion? If a trillion kids stood on top of each
      other, they would reach way, way, way beyond the moon. Beyond Mars and
      Jupiter too, and almost as far as Saturn&rsquo;s rings. If you wanted to
      count from one to one trillion, it would take you almost 200, 0000 years
      and if you put a trillion goldfish in a goldfish bowl, the bowl would have
      to be as big as a city harbor. If you put one trillion of our stars onto a
      gigantic roll of paper, it would stretch all the way from New York to New
      Zealand.
