    <p>Mac: Hey Jan, I&rsquo;m interested in writing a
        song.</p>

    <p>Jan: Why are you interested in writing a
        song?</p>

    <p>Mac: Watching Brandon Boyd perform live inspired
        me.</p>

    <p>Jan: I get bored when I listen to Bordon
        Boyd.</p>

    <p>Mac: Okay, so what kind of music are you
        interested in?</p>

    <p>Jan: I am captivated by the noise that metal bands
        make.</p>

    <p>Mac: Oh, no offense, but I
        am annoyed by noisy music.</p>

    <p>Jan: It&rsquo;s okay, I understand why some people are
        frightened by the noise they make.</p>

    <p>Mac: I am relieved that you are not mad about my
        opinion.</p>

    <p>Jan: Don&rsquo;t worry; I&rsquo;m actually fascinated by
        your courage to share your thoughts about my music taste.</p>

    <p>Mac: Sometimes I&rsquo;m worried about the
        future.</p>

    <p>Jan: Why?</p>

    <p>Mac: I just don&#39;t want to leave things
        unsettled.</p>

    <p>Jan: &hellip;.</p>

    <p>Mac: Why are you giving me a perplexed look?
    </p>

    <p>Jan: I&rsquo;m just surprised you said that.</p>

    <p>Mac: I&rsquo;m shocked that you&rsquo;re not
        troubled by my random thoughts.</p>

    <p>Jan: Why would I?</p>
