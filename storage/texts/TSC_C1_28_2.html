		Group Visit</p>

	<p>Dear
		Mr. Smith,</p>
	<p>Hello,
		my name is Jared Tate. What I am is a professor in the History
		Department at Clark University in downtown Maryville.</p>
	<p>What
		I am teaching is an introductory history course for freshmen this
		semester.</p>
	<p>What
		I thought was to attend the event featuring Mr. Campbell.
	</p>
	<p>Not
		only would it be helpful to my profession, but for my class.
	</p>
	<p>Mr.
		Campbell outshines the rest of the speakers.
	</p>
	<p>What
		I thought is his talk is very pertinent to the subjects I am
		currently on with my students.
	</p>
	<p>What
		I also wonder is if it would be possible to set a meeting with him.
	</p>
	<p>The
		students which I am teaching now would want to ask him some
		questions.
	</p>
	<p>Nowhere
		in the dictionary will describe my excitement in meeting him.
	</p>
	<p>What
		I would appreciate if you read my email.
	</p>
	<p>I
		hope to hear back from you soon.</p>

	<p>Jared
		Tate</p>
	<p>History
		Department, Clark University</p>
