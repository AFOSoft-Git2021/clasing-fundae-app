    <p>Jake:&nbsp;I wanted to go swimming but I am busy with school work.</p>

    <p>
      Ann:&nbsp;You can still go swimming; however, you have to do your school
      work during weekends.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Jake:&nbsp;I know. What about you? Aren&rsquo;t you going to join the
      swimming team?
    </p>

    <p>
      Ann:&nbsp;I am really eager to join but on the other hand the exams are
      near so I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Jake:&nbsp;First of all, you can study now, so you don&rsquo;t have to
      worry about it. You can still join the team.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Ann:&nbsp;I can do it but at the same time I don&rsquo;t want to. I really
      need to focus on the exams.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Matt:&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think it is a good idea. We are soon to
      graduate.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Ann:&nbsp;That&rsquo;s right. My family is expecting a lot, especially
      from my mom.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Jake:&nbsp;All parents, in general, are expecting a lot from their
      children.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Matt:&nbsp;Well,&nbsp;at least, their expectations can be our
      motivation.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Jake:&nbsp;In conclusion, Ann can&rsquo;t join the team for now.</p>
