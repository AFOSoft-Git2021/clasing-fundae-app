	<p> Dear Mr. Mills,</p>


	<p> I am writing in reply to your complaint about the noise levels coming from the surrounding businesses
		around the apartment complex. </p>


	<p> I don’t want to reinvent the wheel but a few people living on the west wing of the building have
		expressed concern over the noise levels. </p>


	<p> The building committee does not want to beat around the bush. Thus, they have conducted meetings over
		this issue.</p>


	<p> We have talked to the businesses already. However, some of the noises are inevitable due to the nature
		of their businesses. </p>


	<p> We don’t want to cut corners but we want to make sure we provide the right solution.
	</p>


	<p> Out of pocket, we are going to fortify the windows with noise-proof glass.
	</p>


	<p> Once we have finalized the proposals, we will roll up our sleeves in no time.
	</p>


	<p> Until then, we ask for your continued patience.</p>
