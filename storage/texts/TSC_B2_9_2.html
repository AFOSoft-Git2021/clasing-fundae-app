    <p><span>Dear diary,</span></p>
    
    <p><span>It was sunny yesterday, but in contrast, it&rsquo;s raining today. I can&rsquo;t play
            outside, and I&rsquo;m tired anyway. I can&rsquo;t go out, but on the other hand, I can watch movies the
            whole day.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>I was watching a cartoon. The characters were similarly dressed. They dress in the
            same way my dad does. There&rsquo;s a difference though. My dad wears dark clothes, in contrast to their
            warm clothes.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>I want to order a whole pizza for myself, but on the other hand, I don&rsquo;t have
            money. I want to eat it in the same way a cartoon character does.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>I was watching a cartoon. He made a tasty drink and I did likewise. My drink was
            bland, in contrast to his sweet version.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Sincerely,</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Mark</span></p>
