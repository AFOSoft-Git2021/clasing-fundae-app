    <p>Dear Stef,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your email. I hope you are feeling better now.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      You are still probably taking some medicines for the pain but I hope you
      won&rsquo;t need them soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      I will likely visit you in the summer when it is a holiday in
      school.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      How is your dog, chao? He probably gained a pound! The last time I saw him
      was a year ago, he was so tiny back then.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      I have been doing some yoga recently and guess what, I will likely fit on
      the dress you gifted me!&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Oh, David and I are in an on and off relationship. He is likely to react
      emotionally to all things I am saying. I don&rsquo;t know why he is like
      that. He is probably going to break up with me.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      You said in the letter, you will probably visit Japan soon. I know
      you&rsquo;ve invited me but I haven&rsquo;t asked mom. She will likely say
      no but I am going to try. I will probably let you know as soon as possible
      if I can come.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      I can&rsquo;t wait to see you this summer, We&rsquo;ll probably stay up
      all night!&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Get well soon,&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Sincerely,&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Tiff</p>
