    <p>Eve:&nbsp;Would you care to join us for dinner, Andrea?</p>

    <p>
      Andrea:&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve just got to put on my makeup. What about you
      Beth?&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Beth:&nbsp;I think I can&rsquo;t join. I can&rsquo;t afford to spend any
      more money.
    </p>

    <p>
      John:&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t need to spend money. You need to change your
      shopping habits.
    </p>

    <p>Beth:&nbsp;I fail to change my habits all the time.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Eve:&nbsp;We&rsquo;ll have to hurry to catch the last train.</p>

    <p>
      John:&nbsp;Hey Eve, before we leave, Don&rsquo;t forget to take out the
      garbage. Mom will kill me!
    </p>

    <p>Andrea:&nbsp;Guys, we have to consider where we will eat.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Beth:&nbsp;Somewhere cheap, please. It&rsquo;s worth spending less money
      on eating out.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      John:&nbsp;Are you going to attempt to delete your shopping apps, Beth?
