    <p>Dear Eli,&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Thank you for your letter. It was so nice of you to do it.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Well, I never thought I&#39;d have fun on my first day at school. I know
      English is not my first language, that&#39;s why I had a hard time
      understanding everyone because they speak so quickly.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      But, I only made some friends. Tom and Ana are such nice people. They like
      reading, writing, and other such hobbies. They are so good at reading
      aloud.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      I met one of the nicest teachers at school. Teacher Alis, She is so
      helpful to me. We had such a good time in her Science class. She can be
      scary when she gets mad, there were two boys in the class, they were so
      noisy. I never thought they could do such a thing in class.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Our school is huge. You should see our library, we have so many books to
      choose from!&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are going to visit the library just bring a jacket, so you
      won&rsquo;t catch a cold, it&rsquo;s freezing there.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope you could be here to try the food in the cafeteria. They have such
      tasty meals but some of the snacks can be so expensive that I have to
      bring mine.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope we live close, so you can visit me anytime. Well, time flies so
      fast, I am sure we&rsquo;ll see each other soon.
    </p>

    <p>Your loving friend,&nbsp;</p>
