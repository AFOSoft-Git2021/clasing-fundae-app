	<p>Dear
		Ms. Zimmerman,</p>
	<p>I
		recently read an article in the Madison Business Update.</p>

	<p>A
		new factory is soon to be opened in Madison.
	</p>

	<p>As
		a former employee of Sun Microchips, I was excited to be hired once
		again.
	</p>
	<p>I
		always loved working there.
	</p>
	<p>Please
		see the attached file for my updated CV.
	</p>
	<p>Iâ€™ll
		be jumping over the moon to be given a chance for an interview.
	</p>

	<p>Anytime
		on December 10 will work for me.
	</p>
	<p>If
		you would like to learn more about my past work experience with Sun
		Microchips, my former supervisor, Todd Smith is someone to be
		contacted about it.
	</p>
	<p>I
		hope to be hired once again.
	</p>
	<p>I
		look forward to meeting you.</p>
	<p>Jake
		Henry</p>
