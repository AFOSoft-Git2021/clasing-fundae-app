    <p>Bea: Cara, What&#39;s wrong? Why do you feel sad?</p>
    <p>Cara: Jake just broke up with me.</p>
    <p>Bea: I&#39;m sorry. When did this happen?</p>
    <p>Cara: Yesterday. I didn&#39;t even know it was coming. He just told me he found
        someone else.</p>
    <p>Bea: I am a little bit confused because I thought you two are getting
        married.</p>
    <p>Cara: I am too. I was delighted last week because he had a surprise gift and now I
        don&rsquo;t know what happened.</p>
    <p>Bea: Do you know the new girl?</p>
    <p>Cara: I saw some pictures. I hate her!</p>
    <p>Bea: You shouldn&rsquo;t feel outrage to the girl, you have to be mad at Jake
        only.</p>

    <p>Cara: I&rsquo;m sorry. I am just curious why he chose her over me. We&rsquo;ve been
        together for two years.</p>

    <p>Bea: I am appalled at Jake&#39;s decision too. Maybe there are reasons why. Do you
        want me to talk to him?</p>

    <p>Cara: No! I will do it. I need to be composed when I meet him.</p>

    <p>Bea: Well, just call me. I am hopeful that you two can fix this situation.</p>
