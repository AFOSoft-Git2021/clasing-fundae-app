    <p>
      Mateo:&nbsp;Have you heard? This barber shop will be closed for
      renovation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kyle:&nbsp;This shop is owned by Mr. Chong. No wonder it&#39;s growing.
    </p>

    <p>Mateo:&nbsp;Mr. Chong is loved by his customers.</p>

    <p>Kyle:&nbsp;When will the renovation start and when will it finish?</p>

    <p>
      Mateo:&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not sure when it will start. But, from what I heard,
      the renovation will be finished in February.
    </p>

    <p>Kyle:&nbsp;Oh, that will take a long time.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Mateo:&nbsp;Yeah. I heard, the renovation will be handled by Mr. Chong
      himself. His new clippers are made in gold.
    </p>

    <p>Kyle:&nbsp;A while ago, the walls were being painted when I arrived.</p>

    <p>
      Mateo:&nbsp;It seems like the renovation has started. A friend of mine was
      talked to by Mr. Chong. Over ten new clippers have been produced in the
      past two weeks. The production of the new clippers is also handled by Mr.
      Chong.
