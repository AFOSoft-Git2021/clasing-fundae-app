    <strong>Hayley: </strong>Hey Oliver! Will I have finished my essay before the semester break?</p>
    <strong>Oliver: </strong>You will not have finished your essay if you keep slacking off. Take me as an example. I will have finished my essay because I manage my time well. I will have reminded you about your essay a couple of times.</p>
    <strong>Hayley: </strong>But I know you. You will have forgotten to remind me.</p>
    <strong>Oliver: </strong>Well, I will have asked someone to remind me about that.</p>
    <strong>Hayley: </strong>I feel like I will not have finished my essay before the semester break.</p>
    <strong>Oliver: </strong>You'll have gone to school even during our semester break.</p>
    <strong>Hayley: </strong>I don't want that. My mom would not have allowed me to go outside.</p>
    <strong>Oliver: </strong>Will you have learned enough to finish your essay?</p>
    <strong>Hayley: </strong>I will have forgotten about the essay when I get home.</p>
    <strong>Oliver: </strong>If that's the case, I will have texted your mom to remind you.</p>
    <strong>Hayley: </strong>She'll have forgotten that because she's always busy.</p>
    <strong>Oliver: </strong>Then, I will have been there at your house to help you finish the essay.</p>
    <strong>Hayley: </strong>Okay. We will have finished my essay before the semester break.</p>
