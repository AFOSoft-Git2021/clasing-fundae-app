    <p>Luke: Hi Emma, How do you get to work?</p>
    <p>Emma: I usually take the bus when it is not rush hour. When I still have time, I
        always take a taxi. And you? How do you get to school?</p>

    <p>Luke: I take the subway, it is the easiest for me. But, sometimes, I go to school by
        bicycle if I am not running late.</p>

    <p>Emma: Woah, Isn&rsquo;t it dangerous? I think it is better to go by your
        motorcycle?</p>

    <p>Luke: Well, that&rsquo;s true. I go by bicycle as a form of exercise too. Have you
        seen the prices of cars? I think the prices of cars are getting more expensive.</p>

    <p>Emma: That&rsquo;s right. I am actually planning to buy but I have to get a car loan.
        I am losing money by taking the taxi.</p>
    <p>Luke: A car loan is a good idea. You know, you should try taking the train to go to
        work. Will that be easier for you?</p>

    <p>Emma: I took the train once but the bus is better for me. Anyway, are you joining us
        for the trip this Friday? We are going to Cave Island by boat.</p>

    <p>Luke: Oh yes, I will definitely join. I am hoping to ride a horse on the
        island.</p>

    <p>Emma: Exactly! I cannot wait. We also booked a yacht ride the next day.
