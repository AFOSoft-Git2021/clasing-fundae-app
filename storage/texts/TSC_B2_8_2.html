    <p><span>Dear diary,</span></p>
    
    <p><span>I was evidently upset by the news of the accident. The guy was evidently under the
            influence of alcohol. Therefore, he wasn&rsquo;t in the right state to drive. He still chose to drive and
            consequently hit another car. He blocked the road, hence the traffic.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Strict road protocols have been implemented as a result of the accident. The guy was
            evidently irresponsible to drive while drunk. He will face charges as a result of his
            irresponsibility.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>In summary, drink responsibly. Being aware and responsible will benefit you in the
            long run.</span></p>
 
    <p><span>Yours,</span></p>
    <p><span>John</span></p>
