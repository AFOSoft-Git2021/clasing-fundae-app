	<p>
		Certainly,
		each of us has felt an uncomfortable jealous twinge at some point in
		a relationship.
	</p>
	<p>
		Due
		to our cherished connection being threatened, we feel jealous at
		times.
	</p>
	<p>
		We
		feel anxious that our loved one may find someone else to replace us.</p>

	<p>
		<b>Take
			a look below and see if you&rsquo;ve had experience with someone who
			presents any of these types:</b>
	</p>

	<p><b>Insecurity</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Hands
		down, insecurity is the most common source of jealousy.
	</p>
	<p>
		People
		often throw around the term &quot;inferiority complex,&quot; which is
		not a clinical term, but refers to an underlying impoverished ego or
		low <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/self-esteem">self-estee</a>m.</p>
	<p>
		For
		example, a jealous man might feel insecure due to the fact that he is
		not confident and he doesn't feel valuable enough.
	</p>

	<p>
		It&rsquo;s
		important to note that insecurity is usually not absolute in men and
		women. Due to a real fact that a woman may be bright and highly
		effective at work as a high-powered lawyer, though her
		psychopathology (getting jealous) comes out in her romantic
		relationships. Overall, is she an insecure woman? No, but she has the
		capacity to become deeply jealous and anxious in her romantic
		relationships.</p>

	<p><b>Obsessive Thinking</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		A
		recent female client of mine in her late 20s, whom I&rsquo;ll call
		Maryanne, finds herself feeling jealous in almost every relationship
		she has.
	</p>
	<p>
		She
		also meets several criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder due to
		being diagnosed once.
	</p>
	<p>
		Maryanne&rsquo;s
		brain tends to work on perpetual overtime, always generating new
		anxieties and anxious feelings.
	</p>
	<p>
		In
		Maryanne&rsquo;s general thinking style, she is not conscious that
		she tends to overthink and obsess about things inevitably.
	</p>

	<p><b>Conclusion</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		The
		next time a partner engages in jealousy-type behavior with you,
		remember to be conscious and put the behaviors and feelings in
		context.
	</p>
	<p>
		We
		have to consider if this jealousy is new, or whether it reflects a
		longstanding pattern. If you&rsquo;re in a relationship with someone
		who has a history of getting jealous, be more conscious that the root
		of this type of behavior&mdash;insecurity, obsessiveness, or a
		paranoid personality&mdash;is not going away anytime soon.
	</p>
	<p>
		Without
		clear boundaries, men and women who get jealous can be very bad for
		your mental health.</p>
