	<p>
		This
		is Ron Brixton from CCR News. I&rsquo;m here at the WingTip shoe
		store next to Hyde Park, where hundreds of people are said to be
		waiting to buy the new running shoe the company will release
		tomorrow.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some
		people happened to be camping here overnight or took the day off work
		to be here.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&rsquo;m
		killing two birds with one stone here, I&rsquo;ll make sure to have
		one and sell it at a higher price,&rdquo; a customer who has been
		waiting in line since 3 in the morning. .
	</p>
	<p>
		The
		new shoe is believed to be upgrading WingTip&rsquo;s last pair of
		shoes because of their new Boost technology.
	</p>

	<p>
		The
		Boost technology is made with three stripes of an innovative material
		the company has been developing since last year.</p>

	<p>
		To
		show appreciation to its most loyal customers, WingTip is said to be
		releasing a limited edition pair on the first day of sales, which
		features the signature of the Chicago Blue&rsquo;s star forward Jerry
		Halliwell. </p>
	<p>
		People
		are still arriving at the shop because they believe the pairs will be
		sold in no time.
