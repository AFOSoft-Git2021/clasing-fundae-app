      <b>Questions: TSC-C1_44_16 until C1_44_20</b>
    </h3>

    <p>Hello, Ms. Grayson.</p>

    <p>This is Michael Cook calling from Alliance Financial Bank.</p>

    <p>
      Just FYI, some clients who renewed their credit card this month were sent
      the wrong card.
    </p>

    <p>
      I could not bear to shake my head because we have been receiving multiple
      calls from bank members with this dilemma.
    </p>

    <p>
      ATM, there were clients coming in with a credit card with someone else’s
      name on it.
    </p>

    <p>According to our records, you were also sent the wrong credit card.</p>

    <p>
      We ask that you please dispose of the credit card by cutting it with a
      pair of scissors ASAP.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the meantime, we will issue a new credit card and have it delivered by
      express mail.
    </p>

    <p>The ETA of your new credit card will be today.</p>

    <p>We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
  </body>
