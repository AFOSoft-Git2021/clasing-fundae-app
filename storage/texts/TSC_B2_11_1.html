    <p>Ben: Why are you upset?</p>
    <p>Matt: I&rsquo;ve been doing the project
        myself.</p>
    <p>Ben: You need only just request and I can
        help.</p>
    <p>Matt:You needn&rsquo;t bother about this project, I
        have the other groupmates.</p>
    <p>Ben: Need I to unite the team?</p>
    <p>Matt:You needn&#39;t worry about that, I will speak to
        them.</p>
    <p>Ben: The changes need only be small. You will finish this
        project soon.</p>

    <p>Matt:I hope so. A deadline needs to be imposed with the
        groupmates.</p>
    <p>Ben: You are right. But maybe, we can ask the teacher for
        more days. We need simply just inquire.</p>
    <p>Matt:Anyways, Did you read the book in history
        class?</p>
    <p>Ben: Yeah, I did. If you need any help, You needn&#39;t read
        this book. I&#39;ll summarize it for you.</p>
    <p>Matt:You needn&#39;t worry about that, I&rsquo;ll read
        it at home tonight.</p>
    <p>Ben: I have to get going. I needed to have my hair
        trimmed.</p>
