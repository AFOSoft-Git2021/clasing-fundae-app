    <p>Nature</p>

    <p>
      Different fruits and vegetables have different geometrical shapes; take
      the example of orange, it is a sphere and after peeling it, one might
      notice how the individual slices form the perfect sphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking closely at a honeycomb, one will see hexagonal patterns arranged
      tandemly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The flowers exhibit the &ldquo;six-around-one&rdquo; patterns, also called
      &ldquo;Closest Packing of Circles,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hexagonal
      Packaging,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tessellating Hexagons.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>Art</p>
    <p>
      The formation of shapes is a result of the use of geometrical forms like
      circle, triangle, square, mandala, or octagon. Moreover, the contents of
      paintings or sculptures are largely affected by the choice and shape of
      frames.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not to forget that the principles of projective geometry form the basis of
      perspective, which is used in most of the painting.
    </p>

    <p>Triangle</p>
    <p>
      Triangle is a polygon, which is made of three sides and consists of three
      edges and three vertices. Also, the sum of its internal angles equals to
      180o.
    </p>

    <p>Circle</p>
    <p>
      Locus of all points at a fixed distance from a reference central point is
      called a Circle.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Square</p>
    <p>
      Square is a quadrilateral where all the four sides and angles are equal
      and the angles at all the vertices are equal to 90&deg; each.
