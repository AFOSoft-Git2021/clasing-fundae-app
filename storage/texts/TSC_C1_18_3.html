		Business Contract</p>

	<p>Dear
		Mr. Smith,</p>
	<p>I
		am Sharron Biggs, CEO and founder of BiggsGraphics.
	</p>
	<p>I
		actually came across your advertisement seeking partnership with a
		graphic design company for a number of your projects.
	</p>

	<p>Fortunately,
		BiggsGraphics has extensive experience working with various small
		businesses and companies in designing advertising campaigns, logos,
		and websites.
	</p>

	<p>There
		have been decreasing projects for big companies, apparently, we are
		still in business.
	</p>

	<p>Thankfully,
		we have skilled and well-experienced employees.
	</p>

	<p>I
		have attached a number of our past designs to illustrate what we
		specialize in.</p>
	<p>Our
		website www.biggs-graphics.com also has some information about our
		company.</p>

	<p>I&rsquo;m
		certainly interested in working with your company on your projects
		and hope we can build a beneficial partnership.
	</p>

	<p>I
		look forward to your reply.</p>
	<p>Sincerely,
		Sharron Biggs</p>
	<p>CEO,
		BiggsGraphics</p>
