    <h2>Months of the year</h2>
    <p>
      Hi. I am teacher Fazura, the most brilliant and beautiful teacher in this
      school. Today, I would like to teach you the months of the year.
    </p>

    <p>
      January &ndash; It is the first month of the year. It has 31 days.
      Everyone celebrates the New Year on this 1st&nbsp;day of January.
    </p>

    <p>
      After January is February. It&rsquo;s the shortest month of the year and
      it&rsquo;s very special! It has 28 days usually but every 4 years, it has
      gone one more day to end up with 29. This extra day is called leap day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third month of the year is March. What&rsquo;s interesting in the
      middle of March is we usually go for vacations during the
      1st&nbsp;semester break.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next is April. It has 30 days. Some people celebrate April Fools&rsquo;
      Day in this month. It is an annual celebration in some European and
      Western countries commemorated on April 1 by playing practical jokes.
    </p>

    <p>
      After April is May. It is the fifth month of the year. Every year in May,
      we celebrate Mother&rsquo;s Day and teacher&rsquo;s Day.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      The sixth month of the year is June. It is just in the middle of the year.
      In June, we celebrate Father&rsquo;s Day.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next month after June is July. It has 31 days. Usually this month is
      the most boring month as the school has just started after 2 weeks of
      holiday.
    </p>

    <p>
      August is the eight-month of the year and you can remember this number
      with UGLY because it&rsquo;s an ugly thing to do to count from one to
      eight. There are so many holidays this month such as Tom Sawyer&rsquo;s
      birthday on August 2, Constitution Day on August 17, and National Aviation
      Day on August 19. This can be remembered easily by thinking that August is
      a very important holiday month!
    </p>

    <p>
      September is the ninth month of the year. It has 30 days. You can remember
      this number by thinking that it&rsquo;s a very good month because everyone
      gets good marks on their report card!
    </p>

    <p>
      October is the tenth month of the year. Halloween takes place in October,
      so you&rsquo;ll have all sorts of candies to eat at school or work! You
      can remember how many days it has by thinking that it&rsquo;s always
      Halloween because &ldquo;October&rdquo; sounds like &ldquo;All
      Hollow&rsquo;s Eve&rdquo;.
    </p>

    <p>
      November is the eleventh month of the year and you will probably have some
      snow before winter starts, especially if you live where I do in Canada
      Remember this number with No rain, No flowers because there are no flowers
      in this month and it&rsquo;s also a good idea to remember that there is no
      rain in November!
    </p>

    <p>
      December is the last month of the year. It has 31 days. You can remember
      how many days by thinking that there are lots of holidays, such as
      Christmas and Hanukkah and Boxing Day and New Year&rsquo;s
      Eve&hellip;which means December has tons of parties!
