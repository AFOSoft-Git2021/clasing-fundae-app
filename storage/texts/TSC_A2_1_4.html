    <p>Rain fell heavily from the sky.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Roger was getting wet as he walked along the road.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>He was beginning to wish that he should have stayed indoors.</p>

    <p>Cars went by, splashing him with muddy water.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>There were puddles everywhere.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      When the lights changed, Roger began to cross the street. A car is driving
      very fast down the street.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Roger quickly moved away from the street.</p>

    <p>
      Roger looked up and saw thunder. It began to rain. He knew he needed to go
      inside.
    </p>

    <p>
      He started to walk very fast to look for a place. He knew there was no
      shopping center nearby.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>

      street.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>He went in and sat down at a table.&nbsp;</p>
