    <p><strong>Belle:</strong> Have I missed the bus?</p>
    <p><strong>Tony:</strong> No. You haven't arrived late.</p>
    <p><strong>Belle:</strong> Wooh! I'm hungry. I haven't eaten breakfast.</p>
    <p><strong>Tony:</strong> Why haven't you eaten anything?</p>
    <p><strong>Belle:</strong> I haven't finished working on our research. It left me no time to prepare breakfast. My mom also hasn't cooked breakfast. She hasn't seen my dad for a week. So she went for a visit. She has never been to Europe. She might be adjusting to a lot of things right now.</p>
    <p><strong>Tony:</strong> It seems like you're also adjusting. You have been dependent on your mom.</p>
    <p><strong>Belle:</strong> Yes. I haven't tried being independent. This is the first time for me.</p>
    <p><strong>Tony:</strong> We still have thirty minutes until the bus arrives. Have you visited the new cafe?</p>
    <p><strong>Belle:</strong> No. I haven't eaten in a cafe since last year.</p>
    <p><strong>Tony:</strong> Why haven't you tried eating in a cafe?</p>
    <p><strong>Belle:</strong> Well, my mom has always cooked breakfast, lunch, and dinner. That's why I haven't tried eating anywhere.</p>
