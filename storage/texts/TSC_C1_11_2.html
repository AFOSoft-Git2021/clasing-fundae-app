	<p><b>Employee
			Spring Training</b></p>

	<p>Lawrence
		Paper and its franchises certainly have been helping all of its
		employees fulfill their potential. That is why we have been
		organizing two days of spring training.
	</p>

	<p>Fortunately,
		the teams have been putting together a wide range of topics for this
		year&rsquo;s workshops, Including, sales techniques, computer skills,
		communication strategies, and certainly goal setting.
	</p>
	<p>Unfortunately,
		we have limited slots left for other areas. If there is anything you
		have been wanting to learn, send us a message.</p>
	<p>We
		have been planning to incorporate it into this year&rsquo;s spring
		training.
	</p>

	<p>Thankfully,
		we have Nancy Kensington to assist us.
	</p>
	<p>Feel
		free to submit any ideas you might have to Nancy Kensington in the
		human resources department.</p>
