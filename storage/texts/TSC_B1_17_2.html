    <p>Camping is a great way to get outside with family and friends or even by
        yourself.</p>

    <p>As you become a more experienced camper, you may find that part of the fun is
        figuring out what to bring along to meet your needs.</p>

    <p>While you&rsquo;re packing, use this handy camping checklist to make sure you
        don&rsquo;t forget anything important.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The first thing you must bring is a tent. It is a must if you are
            staying overnight. You should save you and your guests from the rain.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Dealing with changing temperatures, campfires and forest bugs can
            be a nightmare, that&rsquo;s why it is a must to have a sleeping bag.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>You should also bring a flashlight because it can be a help to make
            a signal during the night.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>An extra battery is a must, because you never know when you could
            experience a delay.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Camping pillows also feature a layer of insulation, it should help
            your head stay warm while you sleep in cold weather.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>A camping chair makes it much easier to sit around the campfire. It
            is a must to purchase one that is durable and built to last.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Whether you need a surface for family game night, a folding table
            makes camping easier. You should have extra space for prepping meals.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>This is optional but you should consider bringing a hammock. It is
            good for more comfort and easy to set up.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>You must pack multi-tools too. It eliminates the need to select
            separate tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Every camper should have duct tape. You can use it as a
            band-aid.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Both lighters and matches are small and lightweight items you
            should have in your survival kit.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Bacteria will spread easily in an unclean environment. You must
            prepare a health and hygiene kit.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>One of the major benefits of wearing a natural sunscreen is that it
            helps prevent sunburn. You should wear a sunscreen that&#39;s broad-spectrum with an SPF of at least
            30.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>You must not forget to bring insect repellent. It is a must in
            keeping pesky blood suckers at bay.</li>
    </ul>
