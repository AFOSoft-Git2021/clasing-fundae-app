    <p>Abi: &quot;Hey Matt. I&#39;m so happy. I just got a job at a consulting
            firm.&quot;</p>
    <p>Matt: &quot;Congratulations. That&#39;s great!&quot;</p>
    <p>Abi: &quot;I don&#39;t have to worry about finding a job and interviewing
            anymore.&quot;</p>
    <p>Matt: &quot;When do you start?&quot;</p>
    <p>Abi: &quot;I start next Monday.&quot;</p>
    <p>Matt: &quot;You&#39;re going to have to put in a lot of hours, you know.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>Abi: &quot;I know. I&#39;m a little nervous for my first day, but it&#39;s pretty
            exciting because I will meet a lot of new people.&quot;</p>
    <p>Matt: &quot;I am hopeful for your first day.&quot;</p>
    <p>Abi: &quot;Yeah. I&#39;m going to celebrate tonight. Wanna hang out?&quot;</p>
    <p>Matt: &quot;Sure. It&#39;s on you right?&quot;</p>
    <p>Abi: &quot;Of course. How about Toby? Should we call him?&quot;</p>
    <p>Matt: &quot;I don&#39;t know. He&#39;s a little depressed. He&#39;s having a hard
            time finding a job right now.&quot;</p>
    
    <p>Abi: &quot;I should still invite him. I hope he will be determined to find a
            job.&quot;</p>
    <p>Matt: &quot;That sounds like a good idea, I feel sad for Toby because I know he is
            trying his best.&quot;</p>
    <p><br>Abi: &quot;He will not be miserable forever. I can refer him to the new company I
            will be working for.&quot;</p>
    <p>Matt: &quot;You are right. I wonder how he will feel when we give him this
            solution.&quot;</p>
