	<p>Dear Mr. Adams,</p>
	<p>I am pleased to inform you that the campaigns have been succeeding in
		raising public awareness of the issue.</p>

	<p>Fortunately, younger generations have been signing up for our upcoming event.</p>

	<p>The attendees actually have been spreading the campaign on social media.</p>
	<p>They have been sharing how they actually like the message behind it, which
		I find incredible.</p>
	<p>We naturally have been paying for advertisements but this one, it is
		done by the attendees.
	</p>
	<p>We have been preparing for presentations the whole week.
	</p>
	<p>Presumably, we have been printing some samples on the side effects of tobacco and
		vape.
	</p>
	<p>I have been handling the videos, I hope you are willing to print out
		pictures.
	</p>

	<p>I have been thinking of hiring a host that the youth is familiar with.
	</p>
	<p>Presumably,  want a hosts who have been dealing with cutting down smoking
		habits.
	</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, an only meet you within this week.
	</p>
	<p>I hope to see you soon.</p>
	<p>Sincerely,</p>
	<p>Jennifer Law </p>
	<p>Executive Manager</p>
