      There are some things that good language learners do and some things they
      don&#39;t do.
    </p>

    <p>Here are some of the most useful suggestions from studies.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Don&#39;t be afraid of making a lot of mistakes. People often get things
        wrong. Good language learners notice their mistakes and learn from them.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Do group activities. People use language to communicate with other
        people.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        A good language learner always looks for the opportunity to talk with
        other students.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Make notes during every class. Notes help you to remember a new
        language. Look at your notes when you do your homework.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Good language learners often use a dictionary to check the meaning of
        words they don&#39;t know. Some non-native language learners use a web
        translator if they don&rsquo;t know the meaning.&nbsp;
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Think in the language you&#39;re learning outside the classroom.&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        When you&#39;re walking down the street, remember the useful words and
        phrases you are learning. Sometimes, when you&#39;re at home, read a
        sentence in a book to practise your pronunciation.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Do extra practice. Test and improve your language, reading and listening
        skills with self-study material. You can find a lot of language
        materials online.&nbsp;
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Imagine yourself speaking in the language. You may use a recording
        device to hear yourself.&nbsp;
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Enjoy the process. To have fun learning the language, watch a TV series
        or film, listen to songs, play video games or read a book. It&#39;s
        never too late to become a good language learner.
      </li>
