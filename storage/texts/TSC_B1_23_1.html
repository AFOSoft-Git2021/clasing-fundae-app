    <p>Dear Diary,</p>

    <p>Tomorrow, I will wake up at five in the morning. I will brush my teeth and will drink
        a glass of warm water.</p>

    <p>Then I will go for a walk. After that I will make breakfast for my family. I will
        cook lunch and will pack snacks for my husband and daughter.</p>

    <p>I will read the newspaper for half an hour and will spend some time with the plants
        in my garden. After that I will wash clothes while I dust the furniture in the house.</p>
    <p>Then I will take a bath and will meditate for 15 minutes. I will eat lunch at one in
        the afternoon.</p>

    <p>My daughter will come home at 1:30. She will complete her homework and will solve
        math problems. She will then pack her bag for the next day.</p>
    <p>My husband will return from the office at 6:30. After coming home he will go for an
        evening walk.</p>

    <p>In the evening, all the children in our neighborhood will meet in the common playing
        area and they will chit-chat for some time. Then they will play badminton.</p>

    <p>We will eat dinner at 7:30. After dinner we will watch television.</p>

    <p>We will then read for some time and will go to bed by ten.</p>
