    <h2>The Football Game<h2>
    <p>
      Yesterday my brother, John and I went to see a football game. We
        watched our two favourite teams, the Eagles and the Hawks. It was the
        second week of the season and the day was much colder than the week
        before. We arrived at the stadium at 11:30 am, which is a little earlier
        than usual. We were excited because I love the Hawks and he loves the
        Eagles. &nbsp;

      The seats were good, but I wanted something closer to the field.
        However, we sat and enjoyed the game. Well, we&nbsp;enjoyed it until we started arguing. My brother and I both think our
        team is better than the other team. He always says to me that the Eagles
        are faster, stronger, and smarter than the Hawks. I never agree. On this
        day, he was wrong. The Hawks played a lot better than the Eagles. They
        looked stronger and tougher than the Eagles. The won by 15 points.

      One thing I didn&rsquo;t like was that the food and drinks were much
        more expensive than other places, and tasted much worse. I was surprised
        that a hot dog cost $7, which is more expensive than the $3 I pay
        outside the stadium. Also, the hot dog was smaller than normal hot dogs.
        So I was a little sad about my meal, but I planned&nbsp;to get something
        tastier after the game.&nbsp;

      Driving home I talked about how much better my team was than the
        Eagles. My brother was getting angry, and I noticed he was driving a lot
        faster than usual. We were lucky he didn&rsquo;t crash. Finally he saw a
        police car so he started to drive slower. &nbsp;We arrived home around
        7:00 pm, which is later than normal. Usually we get home at about 6:00
        pm.&nbsp;

      Overall, it was a great day. I love going to the game with my brother.
        Even though we argue, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to watch the game with
        anyone else!
