    <p>Dear diary,</p>

    <p>
      I am excited to finish my painting. It will be displayed at my dad&rsquo;s
      office.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am loved by my family. My passion is supported by them. I used to worry
      about my art supplies. Fortunately, my art supplies are paid for by my
      mom.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bright colors are loved by many. I&rsquo;m thinking of incorporating lots
      of bright colors into my art piece. The blending of the colors will be
      handled by my own hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hopefully my piece will be finished tomorrow. It is inspired by a book. A
      book that is written by Harper Lee. This piece is wrapped in multiple
      emotions.
    </p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Andrew</p>
