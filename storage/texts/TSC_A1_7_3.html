    <h1>Christine and Ryan&rsquo;s Daily Routines</h1>

    <p>Christine: Hey, Ryan! Over here!</p>

    <p>Ryan: Oh, there you are, Christine. Sorry, I&rsquo;m late.</p>

    <p>Christine: That&rsquo;s no problem. What held you up?</p>

    <p>Ryan: I&rsquo;ve just had a busy morning.</p>

    <p>C: Oh, really?</p>

    <p>
      R: Yeah. Lately, my mornings have been packed full of things to do.
      I&rsquo;m feeling overwhelmed.
    </p>

    <p>
      C: I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that. What all do you have to do every morning?
    </p>

    <p>
      R: Well, usually I sleep in past my alarm because I&rsquo;m too tired to
      get up. So, my alarm goes off at 6:00, but I usually hit the snooze for at
      least an hour. I normally get out of bed after 7:00.
    </p>

    <p>C: Why are you so tired in the morning?</p>

    <p>
      R: It&rsquo;s my fault. I usually go out with my friends for a drink at
      about 10:00 at night, and so I get back home after midnight. Then I
      usually play video games or look at social media until I finally go to bed
      at 2:00.
    </p>

    <p>C: Oh, that&rsquo;s not good! You should go to bed sooner.</p>

    <p>R: I know! I think I am addicted to my phone.</p>

    <p>C: Okay, so how else is your morning so busy?</p>

    <p>R: Well, as I said, I usually wake up too late.</p>

    <p>C: What else?</p>

    <p>
      R: As soon as I get up, I have to take my dog outside to go potty. Then I
      usually throw the ball for him so he can exercise. By then it is already
      7:30, and I still haven&rsquo;t eaten breakfast, brushed my teeth, or
      gotten dressed. And my bus leaves for work at 7:45!
    </p>

    <p>C: That seems a little tight. How far is the bus stop from your home?</p>

    <p>
      R: It&rsquo;s a five-minute walk if I walk fast, which I always do. I
      quickly get dressed and brush my teeth, and I usually skip breakfast. Then
      I run out the door and rush to the bus stop. If all goes well, I arrive at
      work by 8:45. Then I usually grab a candy bar or a soda before starting
      work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then I work until lunch when I usually go and get some fast food with some
      friends. At the end of the workday, I rush home to play computer games for
      a few hours before I order pizza or fast food for dinner. After dinner, I
      watch TV until around 10:00. Then it&rsquo;s time to hit the bar and hang
      out with my friends.
    </p>

    <p>
      C: It sounds like you could change your schedule around. That would help
      you be healthier and have more energy.
    </p>

    <p>R: Oh, really? What could I change?</p>

    <p>
      C: Well, you could go to bed earlier. After dinner, consider watching some
      TV before getting to bed before midnight. Then you will get at least two
      more hours of sleep.
    </p>

    <p>R: I see. But then when would I see my friends?</p>

    <p>
      C: Yes, you would miss out on seeing your friends at the bar every night.
      You could consider asking them to meet you after work before you eat
      dinner. Or perhaps you can only see your friends on the weekend. But when
      you go to bed earlier at night, you will wake up in the morning feeling
      refreshed. Then you will have enough time to eat a healthy breakfast
      before you head out to the bus stop.
    </p>

    <p>
      R: That is a good idea! I get very tired in the mid-morning. It may be
      because of the candy and soda I eat when I get to work.
    </p>

    <p>
      C: Yes, skip the candy and soda. And also consider using your free time in
      the morning to pack a healthy lunch. Eating fast food every day
      isn&rsquo;t just unhealthy. It&rsquo;s also expensive!
