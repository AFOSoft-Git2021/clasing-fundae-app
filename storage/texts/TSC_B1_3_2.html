    <p>
      Teacher:&nbsp;Good morning, everyone. How did you feel about the exam?
    </p>

    <p>
      Art:&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t understand the first question, but finally I got
      the idea of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bea:&nbsp;I circled the answer, however I had to erase it because I
      didn&rsquo;t read the instruction.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Clay:&nbsp;Both the speaking and listening part were easy, whereas the
      reading, it wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Daisy:<&nbsp;As soon as I flipped the paper, I got lost.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Earl:&nbsp;I finally have a shot to have a perfect score!&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Farah:&nbsp;I think I will have a lower score in spite of studying for a
      month.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Lena:&nbsp;There were complicated questions, for example, the idioms and
      phrases questions.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Jay:&nbsp;I had to read it twice, otherwise I won&rsquo;t understand
      it.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Kate:&nbsp;I could have answered the easy part. Instead, I spent a lot of
      time on the hardest questions.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Paul:<&nbsp;I prefer the old format, unlike this
      one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
