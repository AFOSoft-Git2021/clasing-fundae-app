    <p><strong>Kyle:</strong> I went to the hospital last night.</p>
    <p><strong>Dan:</strong> Is it about your blood pressure again?</p>
    <p><strong>Kyle:</strong> No, it's about an infection. I vomited last night.</p>
    <p><strong>Dan:</strong> What was the doctor's diagnosis?</p>
    <p><strong>Kyle:</strong> I forgot, I just remembered he told me to go to the pharmacy and buy some antibiotics. I gave the pharmacist my prescription, and she also gave me some painkillers.</p>
    <p><strong>Dan:</strong> What else did the doctor tell you?</p>
    <p><strong>Kyle:</strong> He told me to go back to him if symptoms persist.</p>
