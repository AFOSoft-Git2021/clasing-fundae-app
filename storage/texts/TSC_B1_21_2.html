    <p>Dante: Hey, why did you scream?</p>
    
    <p>Andre: I caught sight of myself in the mirror.
    </p>
    
    <p>Dante: I thought something bad happened. What do you
            think about the film we watched at school?</p>
    
    <p>Andre: I don&rsquo;t know. The title itself says it
            all, It&rsquo;s going to be a boring one!</p>
    
    <p>Dante: It was alright for me. I mean, I don&rsquo;t
            know why the students themselves chose that film.</p>
    
    <p>Andre: Did you know that we have to do the Science
            project by ourselves?</p>
    
    <p>Dante: Yes, I do. I started researching the topic
            myself.</p>
    
    <p>Andre: I think it is going to be difficult. I
            can&rsquo;t draw the picture myself.</p>
    
    <p>Dante: You have to ask for help or you can watch
            videos and try it yourself.</p>
    
    <p>Andre: I mean, I am not good as Becky, she does all
            of her drawings herself, I&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
    
    <p>Dante: If only the pen can draw the piece by
            itself.</p>
    
    <p>Andre: I wish that! I think I&rsquo;m gonna get myself a
            cup of coffee.</p>
