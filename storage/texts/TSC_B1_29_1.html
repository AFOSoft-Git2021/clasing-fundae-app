    <p><strong>John:</strong><span>Hey Ben, Why do you look sad today?</span></p>
    <p><strong>Ben:</strong><span>My girlfriend and I had a quarrel, and we haven't been talking to each other since. What would you do if you were me?</span></p>
    <p><strong>John: </span><span>I would call her if I were you.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Ben:</strong><span>If I had the courage, I would call her.</span></p>
    <p><strong>John: </strong><span>Why not go for it? You're lucky you have a girlfriend. If I had a girlfriend, I would not let pride get in the way of our relationship.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Ben:</strong><span>Okay then, I'll call her right now. I would be happy if she picked up the call.</span></p>
    <p><strong>John: </strong><span>Why the sad face? She didn't pick up, huh? It's okay, she would answer the call if she was free. Maybe she's just busy at the moment.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Ben:</strong><span>Thanks John. So do you have any plans? If I were you, I would go buy some food.</span></p>
    <p><strong>John</strong><span>: Yeah! That's a good idea. So what are you going to order?</span></p>
    <p><strong>Ben:</strong><span>If I had a big stomach, I would finish a whole bucket of chicken. I'm not that hungry, so a sandwich is fine.</span></p>
    <p><strong>John: </strong><span>I would finish two whole pizzas if I had a big stomach. I'm not that hungry either, so I think I'll have a sandwich too.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Ben:</strong><span>Hey John, I would be very grateful if you paid for my meal.</span></p>
    <p><strong>John:</strong><span>: Okay fine but you have to treat me next time.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Ben:</strong><span>Thanks John, yes I have you covered next time.</span></p>
