      Mike: Good morning, Bran. We&#39;re going to play tennis this morning.
      Would you like to join us?&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bran: Yes, I would love to. Shall I wear this shirt or that one? I think
      we will sweat a lot.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>Mike: This blue shirt is better for sports.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      Bran: Look at that man standing on the other side of the road, is that
      your brother?
    </p>
    <p>Mike: Oh, right. I will call him.</p>
    <p>
      Alex: Hi, Bran. I bought these new shoes today. Would you like to see
      it?&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>Bran: Are those the new edition?</p>
    <p>Alex: No, those are not out yet.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      Mike: Before we play tennis, let&rsquo;s check some shoes at that
