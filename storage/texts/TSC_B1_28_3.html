    <p>Steve: Hey Ian, are you going to buy the new bike that
        came out today?</p>

    <p>Ian: Hey Steve. Uhm, I don&rsquo;t think so. If I buy
        that bike, I won&#39;t have enough money to pay my rent. I do like the bike though.</p>

    <p>Steve: That sounds awful. Well, if the price drops, you
        will buy it, I know.</p>

    <p>Ian: Let&rsquo;s see. If they make a good offer, I will
        buy it. Why not?</p>

    <p>Steve: Are you going to Ashton&#39;s party
        tonight?</p>

    <p>Ian: If I study now, I&#39;ll go to the party
        tonight.</p>

    <p>Steve: If you help me with the reading part, I will
        help you with the grammar part.</p>

    <p>Ian: That&rsquo;s a good deal! What do you think will
        happen if we don&rsquo;t go to the party?</p>

    <p>Steve: If we don&rsquo;t go to the party, Ashton will
        beat us! I&rsquo;m kidding.</p>

    <p>Ian: If we don&rsquo;t go to the party, we will miss the
        dance show.</p>

    <p>Steve: I am starving. If we go out for lunch now, I will
        order a pizza and fries.</p>

    <p>Ian: Well, If we go out for lunch now, I will order some
        waffles.</p>

    <p>Steve: Let&acute;s go then!</p>

    <p>Ian: Sure!</p>
