    <p>Max and Alice will go to the countryside this afternoon.</p>
    
    <p>Alice is very excited about the trip. She is going to pack a lot of
            food.</p>
    
    <p>She will also bring her favorite hats and sunglasses.</p>
    
    <p>Max is going to bring an umbrella in case it rains. He will be the one to drive them
            to the countryside.</p>
    
    <p>Alice asked Max &ldquo;Why did you bring an umbrella?&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Max answered, &ldquo;The sky is getting dark, I think it is going to
            rain.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Alice did not agree, &ldquo;No, the sky will be clear throughout the
            day.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;It is better to be ready, it is good if you are going to bring your
            raincoat.&rdquo; Max said.</p>
    
    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to think it is going to rain, we will be outside, we will
            play with a lot of animals.&rdquo; Alice happily replied.</p>
    
    <p>Max replied: &ldquo;I hope so! Anyway I am going to the gasoline station to fill some
            gas.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Alice agreed and smiled at him.</p>
