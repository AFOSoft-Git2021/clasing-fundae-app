    <p>Dear diary&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      I want to bring in positive thoughts. I want to look out for opportunities
      and grab them. I won&rsquo;t let negativity come in and corrupt my head.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have to look out for myself. I have to take good care of my body so I
      don&#39;t get burned out. I want to be able to cheer up the people who are
      close to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want to find out how people found their passion. I want to turn into a
      passionate person.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      I want my lazy behavior to turn into productive behavior. I want to pay
      back all the sacrifices my parents made.
    </p>

    <p>
      There will be a time when I will fall down. When it comes, I want to have
      the strength to get back up.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want to make lots of memories. I don&rsquo;t want to pass away living a
      boring life. When death comes for me, I want to look back and think of all
      the moments I shared with my loved ones.
    </p>

    <p>
      I write lots of silly things here. I hope no one finds out about this
      diary.
    </p>

    <p>Good night,</p>
    <p>Robert.</p>
