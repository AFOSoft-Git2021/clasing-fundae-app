    <p>Situation: Lucy and Andrew are talking about their end of year holiday.</p>

    <p>Lucy: Where did you go on holiday?</p>
    <p>Andrew: I went to Beijing with my parents.</p>
    <p>Lucy: How was it? Did you have a good time?</p>
    <p>Andrew: It was wonderful. Beijing is a great city with many historical
        landmarks.</p>
    <p>Lucy: What did you see there?</p>

    <p>Andrew: We saw the Great Wall and other interesting places such as old palaces, as
        well as pandas. They were really interesting!</p>

    <p>Lucy: I went to Beijing once to attend a conference, but I didn&rsquo;t have time to
        travel around. Also, I got stuck in traffic when I was going to a conference.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Andrew: Too bad. You could have stayed longer. It&rsquo;s not difficult to find cheap
        hotels in Beijing.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Lucy: Really? Where did you stay, anyway?</p>
    <p>Andrew: We stay at the Orange Hotel near the Palace Museum.</p>

    <p>Lucy: Was it good?</p>
    <p>Andrew: Yes, it was a great budget hotel. The room was clean. The best thing about
        this hotel is they even have a guide for us. How about your holiday?</p>

    <p>Lucy: I went with my friends. It is my first time on a sailboat.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Andrew: Oh, that&rsquo;s good. My next destination for my next holiday will be
        Thailand. I can&rsquo;t wait!&nbsp;</p>
