      A little mouse lives in a field. Her name is Holly. She loves to run in
      grass and wheat. The mouse gathers seeds and grains. Holly has a sack
      where she puts her grains and seeds. The little mouse counts; one grain,
      two grains, three grains, four grains, five grains-half of the sack is
      filled with grains. One seed, two seeds, three seeds, and four seeds- the
      sack is full. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take this sack of grains and seeds to my
      six baby mice,&rdquo; Holly the mouse says.
