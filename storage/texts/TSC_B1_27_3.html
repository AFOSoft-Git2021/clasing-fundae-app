    <p>Bill: Hi Macy, What are you doing today?
    </p>

    <p>Macy: I will go to the cinema and you?</p>

    <p>Bill: There&rsquo;s an art exhibit in the city. If you
        want to come, call me before 5:00. I need to get tickets.</p>

    <p>Macy: I will see. My boss gets mad when my coworkers
        can&rsquo;t handle the meetings without me.</p>

    <p>Bill: Ask your boss if you can leave early.
    </p>

    <p>Macy: Yes, I will. If you praise your employees, they
        usually perform better. That&rsquo;s what I always tell him.</p>

    <p>Bill: You are right. Well, I hope the art event will be
        successful. If they have food at the event, more people attend.</p>
