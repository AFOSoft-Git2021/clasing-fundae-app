	<p> Man: Hello, Ms. Turner. This is Michael Schmidt calling from the Yorkshire Seaside
		Hotel to chat up with you about one of our seaside rooms. </p>

	<p> It says here that you would like to be informed if a seaside room became available. </p>

	<p> Well, someone has just canceled, so if you would like to upgrade, you may. </p>



	<p> Woman: Oh, great. Now, my son’s birthday party is going to be lit! Thanks so much for informing me. </p>

	<p> How much of a buck will I’ll spending from my standard room?</p>


	<p> Man: Well, it will cost an extra $50 a night. However, the room comes with a larger bed and a hot tub. You may
		also get good grub for less than $10 a person. </p>

	<p> I recommend you visit our website to see pictures and information on the room. </p>


	<p>
		Woman: OK. I’ll look at your website in a jiffy and then call you back with my decision.</p>
