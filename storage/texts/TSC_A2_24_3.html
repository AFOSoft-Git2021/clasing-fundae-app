    <p>Kay: Your house is looking lovely, May.</p>

    <p>May: Thank you, Kay. What do you think of the chimney? Do you like that it is made of
        bricks?</p>

    <p>Kay: Well, I prefer that than a metal chimney. Another cool thing about your house is
        the door handles, are they made of brass?</p>
    <p>May: Yes, they are. My mom thinks a bronze door handle is better. But, I said brass
        is the best material.</p>

    <p>Kay: Well, I don&rsquo;t know. Some people say a stainless steel door handle is good
        too. It is not expensive either.</p>
    <p>May: I&rsquo;ll take note of that. I am thinking of changing my living room floor
        with wood.</p>
    <p>Kay: I think that&rsquo;s a good idea. They say it can last longer. But for me, I
        love the idea of having a marble floor even though it can be easily damaged.</p>

    <p>May: Yes, I hate that it is slippery too. This is a crazy idea but I am thinking of
        having glass doors!</p>
    <p>Kay: That&rsquo;s not a crazy idea! You can even add a glass table in the living room
        to match it.</p>

    <p>May: Be careful in stepping into the kitchen floor because the concrete hasn&#39;t
        been set yet.
        </p>

    <p>Kay: I am just going to put a sheet of plastic into my shoes.</p>
