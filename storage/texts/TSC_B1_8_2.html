    <p>
      Elma:&nbsp;Can we watch another movie? This one is a bit boring.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Alex:&nbsp;Hmm, sure. We have other options like romance or comedy.</p>

    <p>Elma:&nbsp;Please show me the comedy options.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Alex:&nbsp;There is this movie I like about a guy that hears what other
      people think.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Elma:&nbsp;That sounds interesting. Can you give me another cup of coffee,
      please?&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Alex:&nbsp;Sure. Would you like me to bring other snacks?&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Elma:&nbsp;Nope, this is fine. Do you have to do other chores today?</p>

    <p>
      Alex:&nbsp;Not really, I&rsquo;ve done most of the chores the other
      day.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Elma:&nbsp;Oh, alright. I want to tell you that this week, I&rsquo;ll be
      busy, I am going to have a meeting with other business partners about our
      product.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Alex:&nbsp;Wow, there was this man who called me the other week about a
      business proposal.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Elma: Good! I believe we are going to make another website for this
      proposal.&nbsp;
