    <p>Ian:I always pictured myself driving a van instead of a
        car.</p>

    <p>Pao:Interesting choice. I dreamt of driving a truck
        myself.</p>

    <p>Ian:What a heavy vehicle! I don&rsquo;t think I can do
        that.</p>

    <p>Pao:If we allow ourselves to feel terrified, we
        will.</p>

    <p>Ian:I&rsquo;ll see to myself if I can drive a
        truck.</p>

    <p>Pao: I never meant to push the idea to you, you need to
        have the dream yourself.</p>

    <p>Ian:I like to amaze myself with things I can
        do.</p>

    <p>Pao:That&rsquo;s the spirit! I used to think I
        couldn&#39;t get a tattoo. A friend of mine, he was scared himself too. But, we decided to have a matching
        tattoo and viola, we did it!</p>

    <p>Ian:I used to know someone who put themselves in
        trouble, trying to tattoo themselves.</p>

    <p>Pao:I am all for conquering fears but I myself
        won&rsquo;t tattoo my own body.</p>

    <p>Ian: I think we should get ourselves a matching tattoo.
