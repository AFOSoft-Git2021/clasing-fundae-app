	<p>Sunday morning</p>



	<p>Ken mumbles in his sleep “it glittered under the spotlight”. He seems to have brought the drab museum with him in
		his sleep. It’s evident that he savored his night. </p>


	<p>His cat caused a clink of dishes in the dining room. The noise woke him up. The tangy drink comforted his lumpy
		throat. His thirst made the drink palatable.</p>


	<p>Hunger made
		him order a meal. The silverware clinks as he feasts on his meal. His hunger made him savor every bite. The dish
		emits a pleasant scent. His room reeks of spices. The twittering birds
		made for an even better ambiance.</p>

	<p>A dusty room waiting to be cleaned and the cold breath of silence wrapped his drab morning.</p>
