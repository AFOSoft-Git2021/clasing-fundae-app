    <h1>The playground&nbsp;</h1>

    <p>
      It is time for recess. I am on the playground with my friends. First, we
      play hopscotch. Next, we throw a ball.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Later, we see the swings, and we race over to them. I pump my swing faster
      and higher than my friends Jennifer and Peter.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      We get off and run to the slide. We have to wait in line for the slide.
      When my turn finally comes, I climb to the top of the ladder and sit down
      on the slide.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>I push off with my hands and go down very fast.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      I laugh because it is fun. Then the bell rings. I quickly drink some water
      and wave goodbye to Jennifer and Peter.&nbsp;
