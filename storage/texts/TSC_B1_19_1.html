    <p>Annie: Who are you talking to?</p>

    <p>Nate: I am talking to Jade, that&rsquo;s John&rsquo;s
        daughter.</p>

    <p>Annie: Oh yeah, I remember her. She came to my
        friends&rsquo; party before.</p>

    <p>Nate: Exactly. I called her because I am going to give her
        Phoebe&rsquo;s cat. I cannot take care of it.</p>

    <p>Annie: Why! I love that cat. If only I can take care of
        it but Chris&#39;s apartment, cats are not allowed.</p>

    <p>Nate: I know. I have to go home. I need to find the
        cat&rsquo;s suitcase.</p>

    <p>Annie: I think I saw it at Sara&rsquo;s place. You were
        there last week.</p>

    <p>Nate: You are right. Sara is not at home, she is having beers
        at Paco&rsquo;s bar at the moment.</p>

    <p>Annie: You can borrow uncle&rsquo;s motorcycle to go to
        the bar and get her keys.</p>

    <p>Nate: Do you have dad&rsquo;s jacket? It is pretty cold
        outside.</p>

    <p>Annie: Nope, you can take mom&rsquo;s jacket.
