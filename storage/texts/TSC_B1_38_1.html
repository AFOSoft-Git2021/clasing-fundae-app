    <p></p>
    <p><strong>Ken:</strong> I hope it snows soon so I can go ice skating.</p>
    <p><strong>Jaden:</strong> Roller skating is a good substitute for ice skating. Do you want to go with me tomorrow?</p>
    <p><strong>Ken:</strong> I'm not sure if I'm free tomorrow. I might go surfing with my cousins.</p>
    <p><strong>Jaden:</strong> Ouh! I've been reading about surfing recently. I want to learn how to surf the waves.</p>
    <p><strong>Ken:</strong> Surfing is so fun! It's like skateboarding.</p>
    <p><strong>Jaden:</strong> I've been skateboarding for 3 years now. I think that's an advantage when I try to learn how to surf.</p>
    <p><strong>Ken:</strong> I've been surfing for 2 years now but I still haven't tried skateboarding.</p>
    <p><strong>Jaden:</strong> What else do you do in your free time?</p>
    <p><strong>Ken:</strong> It depends on my mood. Sometimes I paint. I love painting. Sometimes I bake. Baking requires precision. How about you?</p>
    <p><strong>Jaden:</strong> I go fishing with my dad in my free time. It requires patience.</p>
    <p><strong>Ken:</strong> That sounds boring.</p>
