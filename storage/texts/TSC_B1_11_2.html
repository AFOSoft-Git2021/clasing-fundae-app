    <p>Sara:&nbsp;What happens if I say no to the trip next week?</p>

    <p>
      Bill:&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think anything will happen. You have the choice
      whether you want it or not.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Sara:&nbsp;I know but Amber wants me to take pictures with her. She will
      probably get mad if I don&rsquo;t go.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Bill:&nbsp;I&rsquo;d like to know why you can&rsquo;t go if it is okay to
      ask?&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Sara:&nbsp;If I go on this trip, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll have
      enough money to spend. It has been hard to save lately.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Bill:&nbsp;If you want we can split the fare of your ticket? If only you
      want to.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Sara:&nbsp;That&rsquo;s nice of you.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Bill:&nbsp;Did you ask your parents if they could help you out?&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Sara:&nbsp;If I ask them, they will probably not let me leave.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Bill:&nbsp;Too bad. Well, whether you like it or not, I&rsquo;ll pay half
      of your ticket&rsquo;s fare.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Sara:&nbsp;Thank you, Bill. Now I don&rsquo;t have to think whether Amber
      will get mad at me or not.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Bill:&nbsp;If only you know how much your friendship meant to Amber.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Sara:&nbsp;You are right.. Hmm, speaking of the trip,&nbsp; I am actually
      thinking if I should bring the tripod?&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>Bill:&nbsp;Well, yes, if it can fit into your luggage, why not.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Sara:&nbsp;I think I can make it work. I need to call Amber if she is
      bringing her drone.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Bill:&nbsp;Whether she will bring it or not, I&rsquo;ll make sure to bring
      mine.&nbsp;
    </p>
