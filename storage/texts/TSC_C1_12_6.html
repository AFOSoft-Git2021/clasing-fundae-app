		<b>Questions: TSC-C1_12_26 until C1_12_30</b>
	</h3>

	<p>Date:
		August 22</p>
	<p>To:
		All Sales Team Members</p>
	<p>From:
		Melinda Lackey,Sales Manager</p>
	<p>Subject:
		Rental Policy</p>

	<p>For
		some time, we allowed sales reps to pay for their car rentals up
		front.</p>

	<p>In
		our initial policy, They have been being paid with their personal
		card or cash and then be reimbursed later.
	</p>

	<p>This
		is no longer the policy. This policy has been being ruled out for two
		months now.
	</p>

	<p>As
		of June 15, all payments for rentals were supposed to have been being
		made with the company card that was assigned to each of you.
	</p>

	<p>Larry
		in accounting has been being informed since this morning that he has
		received 6 different reimbursement forms since then.
	</p>

	<p>I
		have gone ahead and allowed Larry to process those 6 forms. But, as
		of tomorrow, no one will be reimbursed.
	</p>

	<p>I&rsquo;m
		sorry for the harsh tone, but everyone has been being asked to comply
		until July.
	</p>

	<p>If
		you have any questions, please contact me directly.</p>
