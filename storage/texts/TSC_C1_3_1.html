	<p>Hello
		Gina,</p>
	<p><br />

	<p>I
		would like to invite you for a short excursion on the weekend. We are
		going to visit a small town in the north of Spain named Galicia. They
		said that there will be some eye-catching areas where we can take
		photos.
	</p>
	<p>And
		I will also visit a friend that I haven’t heard from for a long
		time. Her name is Vanessa, she has a long, fair-haired, green-eyed
		and long-legged. For sure, you’re going to meet her. People from
		Galicia are heart-warming. That’s why I love visiting the town. I
		assure you that it's going to be a mind-blowing weekend.
	</p>
	<p><br />

	<p>Looking
		forward to hear from you,</p>
	<p><br />

	<p>Warm
		regards,</p>
	<p>Karen.</p>
