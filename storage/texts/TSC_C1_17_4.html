	<p>Dear
		diary,</p>

	<p>I
		regret having been sent to the principal&rsquo;s office. Having been
		scolded by my parents made me think about my decisions. My parents
		were furious at having been called by the principal. My apology
		letter, having been written in small letters, was not visible. I
		seemed upset after having been scolded. After having been scolded to
		think, I&rsquo;ve started to reflect on myself.</p>
