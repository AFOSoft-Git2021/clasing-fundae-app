    <h2>Santa&rsquo;s Eleven Months off</h2>
    <p>
      From December 1st &nbsp;through Christmas, Santa Claus got down to
      business. Making fifty zillion toys for the world&rsquo;s good girls and
      boys. &nbsp;All the month, he worked his rear off. Then he took the whole
      year off!
      <br />
      On New Year&rsquo;s Day, he made a vow, that he would lose some weight,
      somehow. He ate salads, joined a gym, but found these things were not for
      him. &ldquo;Santa, we don&rsquo;t, mind your flaw, they&rsquo;re what make
      you Santa Claus!&rdquo; said his friend.
      <br />
      February&rsquo;s cold and gray, so Santa Claus went far away. &nbsp;To
      Hollywood, the land of stars! Sunshine! Sushi! Flash cars! But when the
      ice of winter thaws, back up north goes Santa Claus.
      <br />
      Last March Santa was disguised. So he would not be recognized. New suit,
      new hair, he trimmed his beard. He look different, He looked weird! The
      children stared with open jaws, then cried out &ldquo;Look it&rsquo;s
      Santa Claus!&rdquo;
      <br />
      In April, when the showers came, he went singing in the rain. Now, Santa
      sings worse than a goose and dances like a clumsy moose. But no one says
      he&rsquo;s bad because you can&rsquo;t say that to Santa Claus!
      <br />
      Last May, Santa had a plan, to sumo wrestle in Japan. Santa faced across
      the mat, wrestlers who were twice as fat! Still he won each match, no
      draws, nobody beats Santa Claus!
      <br />
      In June, Santa lit the flames, to start the Summer Reindeer Games.
      Rudolph, as you might supposed won the races by a nose. But all the
      reindeer got applause from that sports fan Santa Clause!
      <br />
      Here&rsquo;s a secret, in July, Santa was a super spy. He worked for the
      government photographing documents. He did it for a noble cause.
      He&rsquo;s secret agent Santa Clause!
      <br />
      In August when the weather&rsquo;s hot, Santa hits the beach a lot. He
      surfed, he swam, and he got a tan. Santa was a happy man, until a crab
      with sandy claws bit that beach bum Santa Claus.
      <br />
      In September, as a rule. Santa Claus goes back to school. This year, he
      took cookie baking, elf esteem, advanced toy making, basic reindeer labor
      laws. That honor student Santa Claus!
      <br />
      The biggest kid you&rsquo;ve ever seen, is Santa Claus on Halloween. Every
      year, he thinks it&rsquo;s funny to dress up as the Easter Bunny. With
      floppy ears and fuzzy paws, trick or treat &ndash; it&rsquo;s Santa Claus!
      <br />
      Santa spent all of November, resting up for this December. He slept all
      night, he slept all day, and he slept the whole darn moth away! He
      certainly deserves a pause. Sweet dreams to you dear Santa Claus.
