    <p><span>Jaden:</span><span>&nbsp;I woke up early today in order to not be late for
            class. I&rsquo;m trying to be better so that my mom will not get mad at me.</span></p>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <p><span>David:</span><span>&nbsp;I limited my game time so that I could finish my
            project. I need to be better in order to graduate this year.</span></p>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <p><span>Jaden:</span><span>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s good that we&rsquo;re both trying to
            do better. I recently bought an alarm so that I can wake up early. I need to set an alarm in order to not
            wake up late.</span></p>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <p><span>David:</span><span>&nbsp;I bought double-sided tape so that I could finish
            my project faster. My teacher said I needed to finish this project in order to pass his class.</span></p>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <p><span>Jaden:</span><span>&nbsp;I can help you so that you can finish your
            project.</span></p>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <p><span>David:</span><span>&nbsp;Thanks! I do need help in order to finish that
            project.</span></p>
