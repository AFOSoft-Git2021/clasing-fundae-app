    <p>Drew: Hi, Stef. I heard you are trying to build furniture.</p>
    <p>Stef: Yes, you are right. I always wanted a wooden chair. I think my plastic chair
        doesn&rsquo;t look nice anymore.</p>
    <p>Drew: Yeah. I remember that plastic chair. But, have you thought about adding marble
        into your wooden chair? I think that will look different.</p>

    <p>Stef: Hmm.. I&rsquo;ll think about that. I do want to order a stone table, I think it
        can match my wooden chair. What do you think?</p>

    <p>Drew: A stone table? That will look amazing! You can add some gold details in the
        living room to add beauty.</p>

    <p>Stef: I am actually thinking of a copper picture frame to hang on the
        wall.</p>
    <p>Drew: Oh by the way, with the stone table that you will order, make sure that it has
        an iron foot, they said it is a strong type of metal.</p>

    <p>Stef: Oh, yeah. They said it is a good buy. What about you Drew? Do you want to
        change your sofa? I remember it is made of polyester?</p>
    <p>Drew: That&rsquo;s right! I am thinking of buying a velvet sofa. I can imagine how
        soft it is!</p>

    <p>Stef: I think leather sofas are the best for me!</p>
