	<p><i>Dear
			Travis, </i>
	</p>
	<p><i>I
			apologize for taking the time to reply to your last letter. </i>
	</p>
	<p><i>I've
			been occupying myself lately with new activities. </i>
	</p>
	<p><i>I
			started cycling last week. It is a climax activity to do.</i></p>
	<p><i>When
			the road slopes gently downwards, this is where it can get scary. </i>
	</p>
	<p><i>You
			gotta stay focused, otherwise, you will fall.</i></p>
	<p><i>I
			had a friend who lost her balance, luckily, she got her back upwards.
		</i>
	</p>
	<p><i>I
			hope your gardening works well.</i></p>
	<p><i>I
			read somewhere you have to push back the seeds inwards to penetrate
			through the soil. </i>
	</p>
	<p><i>Anyhow,
			you know how it works, all I knew before is trees grow upwards. </i>
	</p>
	<p><i>I
			hope you can see the view while I construct my thoughts. </i>
	</p>
	<p><i>There
			are lots of birds on my porch. The type of birds that migrate
			northwards in spring and southwards in fall.</i></p>
	<p><i>It
			is fascinating how birds fly upwards.</i></p>
	<p><i>Just
			wishful thinking, I kinda wish humans could do it. </i>
	</p>
	<p><i>I
			am wishing to see you soon. </i>
	</p>
	<p><i>Nobody
			gets to live life backwards. Let's look ahead.</i></p>
	<p><i>Let's
			plan soon, otherwise, it won't happen.</i></p>
	<p><i>Your
			loving friend,</i></p>
	<p><i>Irish
		</i>
	</p>
