    <p>Dear Diary,&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      It is a new day to do a lot of things. I&rsquo;ll do the best I can for
      everyone and myself today.
    </p>

    <p>
      I always enjoy making everybody happy. I enjoy making jokes with my family
      all the time.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>I try to make a scene of funny movies we have watched together.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Then, in the morning, I often make toasted bread with eggs with my younger
      brother, Stan. We always make a mess in the kitchen! Whenever my mom
      yells, my younger brother makes a silly face! My dad makes sure to explain
      to my younger brother to always clean the kitchen after using it. After we
      eat breakfast, we do some gardening activities. It is always fun to plant
      new flowers!&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      My dad loves doing yard work. My mom enjoys doing some art, she loves
      painting! Whenever it is the weekend, we like to be active. We always do
      some exercises.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      I love making our fruit juice after exercising! Before we have our dinner,
      my brother and I do most of our homework in the living room.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I can&rsquo;t wait to make more plans tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Sincerely,&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Becky&nbsp;</p>
