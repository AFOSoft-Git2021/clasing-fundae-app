	<p>Dear
		Mr. Cross,


	</p>

	<p>It
		has actually been almost two years since we met.


	</p>
	<p>I
		am quite glad to be collaborating with you again after we worked in
		the same department at Esta Resources.


	</p>
	<p>I
		felt we cooperated very well at that time, and I had been hoping to
		work with you again.


	</p>
	<p>You
		will surely feel that we have very dedicated and hard-working teams
		here.


	</p>
	<p>If
		there is anything I can do to help you make the transition, please do
		come to me for assistance.


	</p>
	<p>Additionally,
		Tech Life has actually added five new managers to our company.


	</p>
	<p>If
		you have time, please visit them when they will all be attending a
		mandatory training session at 3:00 P.M. this afternoon in Room 403.


	</p>

	<p>Sincerely,


	</p>
	<p>Lynn
		Dyer


	</p>
	<p>Director
		of Human Resources Tech Life
