    <p><span>Kim:</span><span>&nbsp;Personally, I think the boys at the back are too
            noisy. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, they shouldn&rsquo;t be that noisy.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Claire:</span><span>&nbsp;To tell the truth, they&#39;re not that noisy.
            From my point of view, they&rsquo;re just having fun.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Kim:</span><span>&nbsp;It is true that they are having fun. But I think
            they&rsquo;re actually bothering the people around them.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Claire:</span><span>&nbsp;To be honest, I don&rsquo;t feel the same way.
            In fact, everyone around is unbothered.</span></p>
    
    <p><span>Kim:</span><span>&nbsp;Maybe I personally just don&rsquo;t like them. To
            tell the truth, I think I&rsquo;m overreacting.</span></p>
