	<p>
		Attention
		employees,</p>
	<p>
		We are going to
		make adjustments to our policies concerning sick leave here at Zimnet
		Corporation.
	</p>
	<p>
		We are considering
		in the long run to reduce the number of paid vacation days.</p>
	<p>
		We are planning to
		increase the number of paid sick days available to employees.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before we make any
		changes, we would like to at least gather the opinions of employees
		on this matter.
	</p>
	<p>
		We will be calling
		out employees at random to know your opinions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tony Nugent is the
		person in charge, He will be collecting and analyzing your
		suggestions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Afterward,
		Management will produce a corresponding policy proposal by February
		24.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once the proposal
		has been made, a meeting will be called to discuss its implementation
		among all of our employees.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let&rsquo;s be
		participative for a change.</p>
	<p>
		Sincerely,</p>
	<p>
		The management
	</p>
