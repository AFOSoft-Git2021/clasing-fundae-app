    <p>Teacher: Hey everyone, I hope you had a wonderful weekend. Our topic for today is
        transportation. It is how you get from one place to another place.</p>
    <p>Can you talk about transportation?</p>
    <p>Eve: So depending on where you live in the world, it looks different. In our
        city, Almost everyone uses a car to get from where they wanna go.</p>

    <p>Eve: You really only see people use bicycles for recreation. You don&rsquo;t see many
        people using bicycles or bikes for transportation.</p>

    <p>Luke: That&#39;s right. You see motorcycles in the summer. But I love riding my
        scooter during summer.</p>

    <p>Adam: In our town, people like to go to places using trains.</p>
    <p>Luke: Last summer, it was my first time taking the plane and traveling to my
        cousin&rsquo;s city. It can be expensive but it is worth the trip.</p>
    <p>Eve: I had an experience riding a limousine. It was my sister&rsquo;s wedding and the
        limousine took us to get to the after party, it was crazy!</p>

    <p>Adam: Cool! The coolest transportation I had experienced was riding a helicopter! I
        have a cousin that was studying aviation. I could never forget that ride.</p>

    <p>Teacher: It is nice hearing all of your experiences. All these types of
        transportations are great technology. I do hope we will be using a lot of electric cars in the
        future.</p>
    <p>We have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from traffic.</p>
