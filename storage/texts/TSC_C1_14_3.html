	<p>
		Man:
		Hello, this is Axel Fischer calling. I might have placed an order
		last week for a blouse that I was going to give to my wife as a
		present. However, I might have ordered the wrong size. This order
		should be canceled.
	</p>

	<p>
		Woman:
		I apologize but that item was already shipped. You&rsquo;ll have to
		wait until it arrives if you want to change the size. The payment for
		this order could not be refunded.
	</p>

	<p>
		Man:
		I&rsquo;m surprised it was shipped so soon after the order was
		placed. By the way, will I have to pay any bucks for shipping?</p>

	<p>
		Woman:
		Unfortunately, yes. According to our policy, an extra payment for the
		return shipping must be paid.
	</p>
	<p>
		I&rsquo;ll
		send you a return shipping label via email in a jiffy. What&rsquo;s
		your email address again?</p>
