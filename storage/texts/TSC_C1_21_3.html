	</h3>

	<p>Health
		Shack might have made a new record as the hottest new hangout for
		fitness buffs and corporate employees alike. >
	</p>
	<p>Owners
		Jill and Barry Baker may have gone to ups and downs to open the shop
		but it is all worth it. >
	</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Getting
		a seat or table at Health Shack might have taken as 30 minutes on a
		good day and the place is always crowded no matter the time of day.&rdquo;,
		Alex, one of their loyal customers. >
	</p>

	<p>Health
		Shack offers only six items on its menu; all are protein shakes
		including the best sellers, Apple Pie, Peanut Butter Cup, and if you
		won&rsquo;t get to try their Tutti Frutti, you may have made the
		biggest regret. >
	</p>
	<p>&quot;We
		were overwhelmed by the response,&quot; says Jill Baker. &quot;In
		fact, everything spread by word of mouth so we didn't even need to
		advertise.&quot; >
	</p>

	<p>&ldquo;We
		might have saved a lot since customers are a form of advertisement
		for us.&rdquo;, Barry Baker said.></p>
	<p>Fitness
		Instructor Julian Miles said, &quot;I love coming here for a quick
		lunch that won't wreck my fitness goals.&rdquo; I might not have
		touched my cooking appliances for weeks&rdquo; >
	</p>
	<p>I
		may have recommended this place hundred times to all my patrons.&rdquo;,
		he added. >
	</p>
	<p>&ldquo;I
		took the train one day and came across Health Shack. I tried their
		Apple pie and it might have been the best I&rsquo;ve had.&rdquo;,
		Cris said, one of its valued customers. >
	</p>

	<p>&quot;I
		come here to get a healthy but satisfying meal during my short break
		with my co-workers,&quot; added businessman Tim Hammer. &quot;Without
		Health Shack, I might have eaten lots of junk food already.&quot; >
	</p>
	<p>Health
		Shack is open from 7:00 A.M. to 8:00 P.M. from Mondays through
		Fridays, and from 9:00 A.M. to 7:00 P.M. on Saturdays. >
	</p>
	<p>It
		closes on Sundays but the owners might have considered opening it
		half day on Sundays. >
	</p>

	<p>The
		owners hope to add new flavors to the menu in the coming months.></p>
