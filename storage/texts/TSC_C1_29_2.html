		Lecture Series</p>
	<p>Date:
		January 24</p>

	<p>Dear
		Ms. Flores,</p>

	<p>I
		work for Facilities Management here at Wurnster University.
	</p>
	<p>It
		was actually brought to my attention that there is a scheduling
		conflict concerning one of your lecture dates.
	</p>

	<p>Room
		305 indeed has been reserved for every Wednesday this semester by the
		Wurnster Debate Club.
	</p>

	<p>Therefore,
		I&rsquo;m absolutely sorry to inform you that you will need to move
		the location.</p>
	<p>We
		could simply move the time if this is one of your options.
	</p>
	<p>You
		may actually visit the facilities management website in order to
		check the availability of other room locations and reschedule the
		talk.</p>

	<p>Jake
		Patterson</p>
