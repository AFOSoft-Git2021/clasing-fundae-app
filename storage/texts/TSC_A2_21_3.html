    <p>Mrs Smith is going shopping with her son.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>They are looking for a present for Mr Smith&#39;s birthday.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Mrs Smith wants to buy him a new camera and Tom wants to buy him a jumper.</p>

    <p>They drive to the department store on the high street.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Mrs Smith uses the escalator to go to the Electrical Department and&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Tom takes the stairs up to the Men&#39;s Clothing Department on the first
        floor.</p>

    <p>When she gets to the Electrical Department she finds that cameras are sold in the
        Photography Department on the ground floor.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>She takes the elevator down and asks the sales assistant there for some help.
    </p>

    <p>She doesn&#39;t know much about cameras and needs some advice. He recommends an
        automatic camera by Olympus, but it is too expensive.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Tom is looking at the jumpers.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>He only has &pound;10 to spend so he can&#39;t buy most of them.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>He sees his mother and they decide to go to the smaller shops round the
        corner.</p>
