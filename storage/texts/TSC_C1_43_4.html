	<p> Subject:Delivery Delay</p>

	<p> Dear Customer Service,</p>


	<p> I received my order from Taylor Fabrics yesterday that I placed two weeks ago.
	</p>


	<p> I cannot bury my head in the sand and accept that my orders are fine. One of my orders was incorrectly
		shipped. </p>


	<p> Additionally, the package was delivered later than promised. </p>


	<p> The invoice correctly reflects my wish to receive 5 yards of the floral pattern fabric, but only 2 yards
		of it were delivered. </p>


	<p> If I did not need these items really badly, I would have turned a blind eye.</p>


	<p> From the moment the package had already passed the delivery date, I had a gut feeling that something was
		wrong. </p>


	<p> Because of this error, I won’t be able to complete the dress I was making for my friend’s birthday. I am
		very disappointed.</p>


	<p> I don’t want to rock the boat and file a complaint. </p>


	<p> I am hoping you can solve this issue before my friend’s birthday. I have to get something off the
		ground by next Tuesday. </p>


	<p> Thank you,</p>


	<p> Tammy Fleck.</p>
