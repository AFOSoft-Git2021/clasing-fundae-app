    <h1>Adverbs of Frequency</h1>
    <p>
      Adverbs of Frequency are adverbs of time that answer the question
      &quot;How frequently?&quot; or &quot;How often?&quot;. They tell us how
      often something happens. Below are the goups of Adverbs of frequency.
      separate them into two groups because they normally go in different
      positions in the sentence.
    </p>

    <p>Adverbs of Definite Frequency</p>
    <ul>
      <li>hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly</li>
      <li>every second, once a minute, twice a year</li>
      <li>once, twice, once or twice, three times</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Adverbs of definite frequency, like all adverbs of definite time,
      typically go in END position.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Most companies pay taxes yearly.</li>
      <li>The manager checks the toilets every hour.</li>
      <li>The directors meet weekly to review progress.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Sometimes, usually for reasons of emphasis or style, some adverbs of
      definite frequency may go at the FRONT,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Every day, more than five thousand people die on our roads.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Adverbs of indefinite frequency mainly go in MID position in the sentence.
      They go before the main verb (except the main verb &quot;to be&quot;):
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>usually go shopping on Saturday.</li>
      <li>I have often done that.</li>
      <li>She is always late.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Occasionally, sometimes, often, frequently and usually can also go at the
      beginning or end of a sentence:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sometimes they come and stay with us.</li>
      <li>I play tennis occasionally.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Rarely and seldom can also go at the end of a sentence (often with
      &quot;very&quot;):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>see them rarely.</li>
      <li>John eats meat very seldom</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Adverbs of Frequency Rules</h2>
    <p>
      These simple rules for adverbs of frequency will help you to use them
      correctly:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Always use adverbs of frequency to discuss how often something happens.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adverbs of frequency are often used to indicate routine or repeated
        activities, so they are often used with the present simple tense.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a sentence has only one verb, place the adverb of frequency in the
        middle of the sentence so that it is positioned after the subject but
        before the verb. For example: Tom never flies. He always takes the bus.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a sentence contains more than one verb, place the adverb of
        frequency before the main verb. For example: They have often visited
        Europe.
      </li>
      <li>
        When using an adverb of frequency in the negative or in forming a
        question, place it before the main verb. For example: Do you usually get
        up so late?
      </li>
    </ul>
