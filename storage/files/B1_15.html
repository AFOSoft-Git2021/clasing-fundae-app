    <h1>Will &amp; Shall</h1>
    <h2>Will</h2>
    <p>
      The most basic and common form used to express the future is
      &lsquo;will&rsquo;. The structure of &lsquo;will&rsquo; is easy because it
      is the same for all subjects and you don&rsquo;t need to change anything
      about the verb.
    </p>

    <h3>We use &lsquo;will&rsquo; for the following situations:</h3>
    <p>a) to describe the future</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We&rsquo;ll be&nbsp;at the hotel until 8pm.</li>
      <li>
        The trains&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;late today because of the bad weather.
      </li>
      <li>How long will&nbsp;you stay&nbsp;in Hong Kong?</li>
      <li>He&rsquo;ll send&nbsp;us the report when he has all the data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>b) to make a prediction</p>

      </li>
      <li>I think I&rsquo;ll stay&nbsp;in this company until I retire.</li>
      <li>She doesn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll pass&nbsp;the exam.</li>
      <li>Who do you think will win&nbsp;the tournament?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>c) to express a decision made at the moment of speaking</p>

      <li>
        So that&rsquo;s the plan &ndash; we&rsquo;ll check&nbsp;the sales
        figures and you check the expenses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Jean&rsquo;s over there. I&rsquo;ll&nbsp;just go&nbsp;and say
        &lsquo;hello&rsquo; before we leave.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>d) to make a request</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Will&nbsp;you bring&nbsp;some more water please?</li>
      <li>Will&nbsp;you come&nbsp;to the appointment with me?</li>
      <li>
        Will&nbsp;you be&nbsp;quiet please? I&rsquo;m trying to make an

    <h2>Shall</h2>
    <p>
      In the past, &lsquo;shall&rsquo; was often used as an alternative to
      &lsquo;will&rsquo;, and you can find many examples of &lsquo;shall&rsquo;
      in famous literary works. But in modern English we usually prefer
      &lsquo;will&rsquo; for affirmative and negative sentences.
    </p>

    <p>
      We form sentences with &lsquo;shall&rsquo; in the same way as we do with
      &lsquo;will&rsquo;.
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>SINGULAR</td>
        <td>PLURAL</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>I shall help</td>
        <td>We shall help</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>You shall help</td>
        <td>You shall help</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>he/she/it shall help</td>
        <td>They shall help</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      The negative form is created by adding &lsquo;not&rsquo;. The contraction
      form, &lsquo;shan&rsquo;t&rsquo;, is something we generally use in spoken
      English but rarely in its written form.
    </p>

        <td>I shall not help (I shan&rsquo;t help)</td>
        <td>We shall not help (we shan&rsquo;t help)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>You shall not help (you shan&rsquo;t help)</td>
        <td>You shall not help (you shan&rsquo;t help)</td>

    <p>
      We make the question by inverting the subject and &lsquo;shall&rsquo;.
      Here is the question form for all the subjects, though we only normally
      use &lsquo;shall&rsquo; in questions with I&nbsp;and we:

        <td>Shall he/she/it help?</td>
        <td>Shall they help?</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>We use &lsquo;shall&rsquo; in the following ways:</p>
    <p>a) to make offers using I/we</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shall I make&nbsp;some lunch?</li>
      <li>Shall we help&nbsp;you with your bags?</li>
      <li>Where shall I drop&nbsp;you off? Outside your office?</li>
      <li>Shall I water&nbsp;your plants while you&rsquo;re away?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>b) to make suggestions using I/we</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shall we go&nbsp;to the park later?</li>
      <li>Shall we have something to eat?</li>
      <li>Who shall we invite&nbsp;to the party?</li>
      <li>What shall we do&nbsp;after we&rsquo;ve watched the film?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>c) to express formal obligations</p>
    <ul>

        month.
      </li>
      <li>The accused shall appear&nbsp;in court again on 26th October.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>d) to make a promise</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I shall&nbsp;never forget&nbsp;the help you gave me.</li>
      <li>I shan&rsquo;t be&nbsp;late.</li>
      <li>We shall do everything we can to solve the problem.</li>
      <li>He shan&rsquo;t be&nbsp;long. Do have a seat while you wait.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>e) to describe the future very formally</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We shall overcome&nbsp;this difficult moment.</li>
      <li>The tests shall be&nbsp;carried out by an independent body.</li>
