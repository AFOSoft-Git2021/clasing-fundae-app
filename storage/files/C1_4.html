	<h1>Adjectives for Quantity</h1>

<p>We
can use number + noun as a compound adjective before another noun.
This construction is often used with nouns of measurement, such as
foot, meter, mile, pound, kilogram, second, minute, hour, pound,
dollar, etc.. Here are things that you should remember about
number-noun compound adjectives:</p>


<ol>
	<li><p>
	Remember adjectives have no plural form in English:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>A
		two-days journey - <i><b>incorrect</b></i></p>
		<li><p>A
		two-day journey - <u><b>correct</b></u></p>
	</ol>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
	<li><p>Use
	a hyphen to connect the number to the noun that follows it. This
	allows the reader to know that both words function as a unit that
	modifies the noun after it:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>A
		30-minute show</p>
		<li><p>A
		two-day journey</p>
		<li><p>A
		50-meter pool</p>
		<li><p>A
		eight-core processor</p>
		<li><p>A
		two-bedroom apartment</p>
		<li><p>six-sided figure</p>
	</ol>
</ol>


</p>
<ol start="3">
	<li><p>Sometimes,
	a compound adjective is made up of more than one word:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>A
		10-million-dollar house</p>
		<li><p>A
		seven-year-old child</p>
	</ol>
</ol>


</p>
<ol start="4">
	<li>When
	you want to make a compound adjective out of a number and a noun,
	use the singular form of the noun and connect the words with a
	hyphen (-). If the number is less than 10, write out the number. If
	the number is 10 or greater, use the numeral</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>five-star hotel</p>
		<li><p>12-hour shift</p>
	</ol>
</ol>


<ol start="5">
	<li><p>If the unit is represented by an abbreviation, use numerals.</p>
	 <ol>
		<li><p>a 5-lb. bag of flour</p>
		 <li><p>two 6-ft. lengths of timber</p>
	</ol>
</ol>


</p>
<ol start="6">
	<li><p>Do
	<b>not</b>
	use a hyphen between a numeral and a non-letter symbol or between a
	numeral and a metric unit symbol:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>a
		90&deg; angle</p>
		<li><p>four
		100 &deg;C thermometers</p>
		<li><p>a
		2.36 m high jump</p>
		<li><p>three
		5 L containers</p>
	</ol>
</ol>
