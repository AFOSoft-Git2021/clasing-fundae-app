    <h1>Present Simple</h1>

    <p>
      The simple present (also called present simple or present indefinite) is a
      verb tense which is used to show repetition, habit or generalization. Less
      commonly, the simple present can be used to talk about scheduled actions
      in the near future and, in some cases, actions happening now.
    </p>

    <h2>Verb Conjugation &amp; Spelling</h2>
    <p>
      We form the present tense using the base form of the infinitive (without
      the TO). In general, in the third person we add &#39;S&#39; in the third
      person.
    </p>

    <h2>Negative Sentences in the Simple Present Tense</h2>
    <p>
      To make a negative sentence in English we normally use Don&#39;t or
      Doesn&#39;t with all verbs EXCEPT To Be and Modal verbs (can, might,
      should etc.).
    </p>
    <h2>Simple Present: Forming a WH- question</h2>
    <p>
      WH- questions (using words such as &ldquo;what&rdquo;, &ldquo;when&rdquo;,
      and &ldquo;where&rdquo;) are also created by putting the auxiliary do
      before the subject. Then, you add the WH- word at the beginning. Here are
      some examples:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>Statement</td>
        <td>Yes/no question</td>
        <td>WH- question</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>I sing</td>
        <td>Do I sing?</td>
        <td>What do I sing?</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>You fight.</td>
        <td>Do you fight?</td>
        <td>Why do you fight?</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>He lives</td>
        <td>Does he live?</td>
        <td>Where does he live?</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>Simple Present: Forming a yes/no question</h2>
    <p>
      Yes/no questions are also created using the auxiliary do. This time, the
      auxiliary is placed before the subject. Here are the rules:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>Auxiliary</td>
