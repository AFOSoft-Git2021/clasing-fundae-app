    <h1>Future Perfect Continuous</h1>

    <p>Future perfect continuous has two different forms: &quot;will have been doing
        &quot; and &quot;be going to have been doing.&quot; Unlike simple future forms, future perfect continuous
        forms are usually interchangeable.</p>

    <h2>FORM Future Perfect Continuous with &quot;Will&quot;
    </h2>
    <p>[will have been + present participle]</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You will have been waiting for more than two hours when her plane
            finally arrives.</li>
        <li>Will you have been waiting for more than two hours when her plane
            finally arrives?</li>
        <li>You will not have been waiting for more than two hours when her
            plane finally arrives.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>FORM Future Perfect Continuous with &quot;Be Going
        To&quot;</h2>
    <p>[am/is/are + going to have been + present participle]</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You are going to have been waiting for more than two hours when her
            plane finally arrives.</li>
        <li>Are you going to have been waiting for more than two hours when her
            plane finally arrives?</li>
        <li>You are not going to have been waiting for more than two hours when
            her plane finally arrives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Used in a Question:</h2>
    <p>The above examples indicate statements made as declarative sentences. That is,
        they&rsquo;re simply making a statement or, perhaps, answering a question. But, the future perfect
        progressive tense may also be used to pose a question. The formula for these
        is will + subject + have been + verb (ending in -ing). </p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>At that point, will you have been
            living in Ireland for ten years?</li>
        <li>Will he have been sleeping for four
            hours by midnight?</li>
        <li>Will we have been studying at this
            university for three years at that point?</li>
        <li>By the time our parents get married, will
            you have been singing for a whole year?</li>
        <li>By our 40th wedding anniversary, will this
            plant have been growing for 35 years?</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>Negative Statements:</h2>
    <p>The future perfect progressive tense may also be used in the negative form to
        indicate a continuous action will not be happening in the future. The formula will read will + not + have
        been + verb (ending in -ing). </p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>At that point, I will not have been
            living in Ireland for ten years - only two.</li>
        <li>He will not have been sleeping for four
            hours by midnight.</li>
        <li>By then, we will not have been
            studying at this university for three years.</li>
        <li>I will not have been singing professionally for one year by the time our parents get married.</li>
        <li>By our 40th wedding anniversary, this plant will not have been growing for 35 years.</li>
    </ul>
