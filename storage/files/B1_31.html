    <h2>Positive Sentences </h2>
    <p>To make the positive sentences, we use this structure,</p>
    <p>Subject + has/have + been + V1(+ing) + &hellip;</p>

    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>He has been playing football for two hours.</li>
        <li>The child has been studying since morning.</li>
        <li>She has been kneading the floor.</li>
        <li>I have been playing my favorite game.</li>
        <li>They have been working in this office since last year.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>Negative Sentences</h2>
    <p>To make the sentence negative, we add &lsquo;not&rsquo; after the auxiliary verb
        (present tense). The contractions haven&rsquo;t and
        hasn&rsquo;t can also be used</p>
    <p>Subject + has/have + not + been + V1(+ing) + &hellip;</p>

    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Julia has not been making a sponge cake.</li>
        <li>He has not been reading his favorite book.</li>
        <li>She has not been planting for three hours.</li>
        <li>They have not been studying since morning.</li>
        <li>I have not been traveling.</li>
        <li>We haven&rsquo;t been selling
            many umbrellas since the drought started.</li>
        <li>As far as I know, Henry hasn&rsquo;t been cheating on math tests since he got caught.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>Question Sentences</h2>
    <p>Auxiliary verbs (present tense) come at the start of the sentence and question
        mark at the end.</p>
    <p>Has/have + subject + been + V1(+ing) + &hellip; +?</p>

    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Has he been
            studying since morning?</li>
        <li>Has she been
            planting for two hours?</li>
        <li>Have they been
            traveling for two days?</li>
        <li>Has the farmer been
            plowing the fields?</li>
        <li>Has he been
            smoking since 2011?</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>Wh- questions</h2>
    <p>The wh- question word comes before &quot;have&quot; / &quot;has&quot; and then followed by the subject and
        the past participle of &quot;be&quot; (been) and
        then -ing of the main verb.</p>

    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What have you been doing these days?</li>
        <li>Where has your daughter been living since she graduated college?</li>
        <li>How long have you been playing tennis?</li>
        <li>Why haven&#39;t you been answering my calls?</li>
        <li>Who has been eating my
            cookies?</li>
        <li>Since when has your back been hurting?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When do you use the present perfect
        continuous?</h2>

    <p>1. One of the main reasons that we use the present perfect continuous tense,
        also called the present perfect progressive tense, is to refer to an action that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>began sometime in the past;</li>
        <li>has continued to happen until the current moment;</li>
        <li>will likely continue to happen for an unknown amount of time.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>2. When we use the present perfect continuous tense, we can refer to specific
        periods of time or general periods of time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Nicole has been rescuing stray dogs since she was a kid.</li>
        <li>I have been going to this store for as long as I can remember.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>3. Often, we use the adverbs lately and recently with the present perfect
        continuous tense to indicate an action began sometime in the recent past (and continued until the
        present).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They have been complaining a lot lately.</li>
        <li>Recently, you have been watching TV a lot more than usual.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>4. Sometimes, we use the present perfect continuous without indicating a
        starting point at all. In this case, we can assume the action began in the recent past. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Now that you mention it, it has been
            raining a lot more often.</li>
    </ul>
