    <h1>Passive voice</h1>

    <p>
      The passive voice is less common. In the passive voice, the subject
      receives the action of the verb:
    </p>

    <p>The basic structure of a passive clause is very simple:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>subject</td>
        <td>+</td>
        <td>auxiliary verb be</td>
        <td>+</td>
        <td>main verb past participle</td>
        <td>+</td>
        <td>by</td>
        <td>+</td>
        <td>agent</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>optional</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      The auxiliary be is conjugated in all tenses. The main verb is always the
      past participle. The agent is the original &quot;doer&quot; of the action.
    </p>
    <p>Look at some examples:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>subject</td>
        <td>auxiliary verb be</td>
        <td>main verb past participle</td>
        <td>by</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>I</td>
        <td>am</td>
        <td>employed</td>
        <td>by</td>
        <td>Apple.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>You</td>
        <td>will be</td>
        <td>woken</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>at 6.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>It</td>
        <td>will have been</td>
        <td>finished</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>by then.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>We</td>
        <td>have been</td>
        <td>notified</td>
        <td>by</td>
        <td>Head Office.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>You</td>
        <td>are being</td>
        <td>transferred</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>next week.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>They</td>
        <td>will be</td>
        <td>paid.</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Notice above&uarr;:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>auxiliary be can be conjugated for all persons and tenses</li>
      <li>main verb is invariable: past participle</li>
      <li>if there is an agent (Apple, Head Office), it is introduced by by</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="break"></div>
    <h2>Passive Voice Sentence Structure</h2>

    <p>Passive subject + to be + past participle</p>

    <p>
      Note that the verb &quot;be&quot; is conjugated followed by the participle
      form of the main verb.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The house was built in 1989.</li>
      <li>My friend is being interviewed today.</li>
      <li>The project has been completed recently.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The passive voice follows the same usage rules as all the tenses in
      English. However, some tenses tend not to be used in the passive voice.
      Generally speaking, perfect continuous tenses are not used in the passive
      voice.
    </p>
    <div class="break"></div>
    <h2>Using the Agent</h2>

    <p>
      The person or people taking an action are referred to as the agent. If the
      agent (the person or people performing an action) is not important for
      understanding, the agent can be left out.
    </p>

    <p>Here are some examples:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The dogs have already been fed. (It&#39;s not important who fed the
        dogs)
      </li>
      <li>
        The children will be taught basic math. (It&#39;s clear that a teacher
        will teach the children)
      </li>
      <li>
        The report will have been finished by the end of next week. (It&#39;s
        not important who completes the report)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In some cases, it&#39;s important to know the agent. In this case, use the
      preposition &quot;by&quot; to express the agent following the passive
      structure. This structure is especially common when speaking about
      artistic works such as paintings, books, or music.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        &quot;The Flight to Brunswick&quot; was written in 1987 by Tim Wilson.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>This model was developed by Stan Ishly for our production team.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="break"></div>
    <h2>Passive Used With Transitive Verbs</h2>

    <p>
      Transitive verbs are verbs that can take an object. Here are some
      examples:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>We assembled the car in less than two hours.</li>
      <li>I wrote the report last week.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Intransitive verbs do not take an object:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>She arrived early.</li>
      <li>The accident happened last week.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Only verbs that take an object can be used in the passive voice. In other
      words, the passive voice is used only with transitive verbs.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The car was assembled in less than two hours. (passive voice)</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>The report was written last week. (passive voice)</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="break"></div>
    <h2>When should we use the Passive?</h2>

    <p>1: When we want to change the focus of the sentence</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Mona Lisa was painted by Leonardo Da Vinci. (We are more interested
        in the painting than the artist in this sentence)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      2: When who or what causes the action is unknown or unimportant or obvious
      or &#39;people in general&#39;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>He was arrested (obvious agent, the police).</li>
      <li>My bike has been stolen (unknown agent).</li>
      <li>The road is being repaired (unimportant agent).</li>
      <li>
        The form can be obtained from the post office (people in general).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>3: In factual or scientific writing</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The chemical is placed in a test tube and the data entered into the
        computer.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      4: In formal writing instead of using someone/ people/ they (these can be
      used in speaking or informal writing)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The brochure will be finished next month.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      5: In order to put the new information at the end of the sentence to
      improve style
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Three books are used regularly in the class. The books were written by
        Dr. Bell. (&#39;Dr. Bell wrote the books&#39; sound clumsy)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>6: When the subject is very long</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I was surprised by how well the students did in the test. (More natural
        than: &#39;how well the students did in the test surprised me&#39;)
      </li>
    </ul>
