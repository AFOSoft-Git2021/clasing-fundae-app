	<h1>Present perfect + progressive passive voice</h1>

	<p>Like
		most other verb forms in English, the present perfect-progressive
		passive is periphrastic, a term which means a &ldquo;phrase of two or
		more words that perform a single grammatical function that would
		otherwise be expressed by the inflection of a single word.&rdquo;&nbsp;


	</p>


	<p>Verbs
		in the present perfect-progressive passive are formed by the present
		tense form of the verb <i>have</i> plus the past participle<i>been</i>
		and the present participle<i>being</i>followed by a past participle (
		<u>regular</u>or<u>irregular</u>).
	</p>

	<p>Note
		that, as with other passive constructions, only <u>transitive verbs</u>
		(verbs that can take objects) and <u>verbs
			with verb phrase complements</u> may be conjugated into the passive voice.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The picture is believed to have been being painted for years.&nbsp;

		<li>My living room has been being painted for two hours.

	</ul>


	</p>
	<p>The
		verb phrase patterns for the present perfect-progressive passive are
		as follows:


	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>first person singular &ndash; have + been + being + past participle&nbsp;

			<ol type="a">
				<li>I have been being treated like dirt.

			</ol>
		<li>second person singular &ndash; have + been + being + past participle

			<ol type="a">
				<li>
					You
					have been being counted twice.


					</p>
			</ol>
		<li>
			third
			person singular &ndash; has + been + being + past participle&nbsp;


			</p>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>
					The
					package have been being delivered late.


					</p>
			</ol>
		<li>
			first
			person plural &ndash; have + been + being + past participle&nbsp;


			</p>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>
					We
					have been being given bad advice.

			</ol>
		<li>
			second
			person plural &ndash; have + been + being + past participle


			</p>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>
					You
					have been being controlled by your parents.

			</ol>
		<li>
			third
			person plural &ndash; have + been + being + past participle


			</p>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>
					The
					prototypes have been being developed in the lab.

			</ol>
	</ol>


	</p>
	<p>Like the <a href="https://linguisticsgirl.com/present-perfect-progressive-english-verbs/">
			<u>present perfect-progressive in the active voice</u>
		</a>,
		the present perfect-progressive passive expresses and emphasizes the
		consequences resulting from a previous but incomplete action or state
		that began in the past and continues into the present but may or may
		not continue into the future.&nbsp;


	</p>


	</p>
	<p>Also
		like the present perfect-progressive active, the present
		perfect-progressive passive occurs most often in sentences that
		express actions that occurred recently and actions that continue up
		to the present.
