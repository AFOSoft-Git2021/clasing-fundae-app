    <p>Cache</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;a type of computer memory for storing information temporarily and
      getting to it quickly
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        All browsers create temporary files that speed up your internet surfing
        by caching parts of web pages that you access.
      </li>
      <li>
        The story is no longer posted on the website but is cached online by
        search engines.
      </li>
      <li>The tool lets you specify what types of data you want cached.</li>
      <li>
        It downloads code over the network, caches it, and runs it in a secure
        environment.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Font</p>
    <p>
      a particular sort of lettering (on the screen or on paper). Arial is a
      font. Times New Roman is another.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When you download the font it may be in a compressed format, such as a
        zip file.
      </li>
      <li>
        &nbsp;If you double click on one of the font names a sample is displayed
        on the screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Object properties can include font, style type, fill or color palette.
      </li>
      <li>
        This information base is then manipulated using a font descriptor file
        to generate a particular font.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Format</p>
    <p>
      All hard disks and floppy disks have to be electronically prepared for use
      by a process called formatting. Hard disks are pre-formatted by the
      computer manufacturer. If you buy a floppy disk that is not pre-formatted,
      you format it yourself, using a program that comes with your PC.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Please format this floppy disc.</li>
      <li>
        The new format has unanimous support and could be introduced next
        season.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you download the font it may be in a compressed format, such as a
        zip file.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>File</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;a specific computer record. It could contain data such as text (e.g.
      essay.doc), or a program such as paint.exe.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I&rsquo;m going to copy/save this file.</li>
      <li>I will send you a copy of the file.</li>
      <li>
        Make a file for these documents and write &#39;finance&#39; on the tab.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Hard disk</p>
    <p>
      A device that is fixed inside a computer and is used to store programs and
      information.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Hard disk drive technology continues its inevitable march toward greater
        areal densities, and hybrid drives are being purchased in greater
        numbers.
      </li>
      <li>I found that the hard disk had been wiped.</li>
      <li>That information gets downloaded onto a hard disk.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Peripheral</p>
    <p>
      any equipment that is connected externally to a computer. For example,
      printers, scanners and modems are peripherals.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The book contains a great deal of peripheral detail.</li>
      <li>
        The system is expected to boost sales of PCs as well as components,
        applications, and peripheral devices.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Pixel</p>
    <p>
      the image that you see on the screen is made of thousands of tiny dots,
      points or pixels
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A high-definition television uses about two million pixels per screen.
      </li>
      <li>Each pixel in a plasma has only two states: on or off.</li>
      <li>
        I know exactly where everything is on the screen, down to the pixel.
      </li>
    </ul>
