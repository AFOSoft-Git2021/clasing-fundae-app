	<h1>PASSIVE PERFECT INFINITIVE</h1>

	<p>With modals and with infinitive forms, the passive is formed with
		<u><b>be + past participle</b></u> or <u><b>have been + past participle.</b></u> &nbsp;
	</p>

	<p>With future forms it is constructed with
		<u><b>be + past participle</b></u> or <u><b>being + past participle.</b></u>
	</p>

	<p>The
		perfect infinitive is often used after the modal auxiliary verbs
		could, would, might, ought, should and needn't to talk about unreal
		situations
