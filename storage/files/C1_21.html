	<h1>May / might + have + past participle </h1>

	<p>Let's take a look at that form.</p>

	<p><b>might</b>


		(modal) +


		<b>have</b>+


		<b>eaten</b>


		(past participle verb)


	</p>

	<p>We
		use the modal might (you can also use may or could) because they show
		that we are not 100% sure about what happened. We are speculating
		about past events (guessing what we think happened).&nbsp;


	</p>

	<p>We
		then must use have followed by a past participle verb.&nbsp;


	</p>

	<p>We
		use 'must' when we have a stronger opinion about what happened.


	</p>

	<p><i><b>Might
				have</b></i>


		is a good alternative in conditional clauses when you want to
		consider different possibilities in the past.


	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>If
				I hadn&rsquo;t planned the party last minute, more people might have
				turned up.


				<i>
					(= It&rsquo;s possible).</i>


			</p>
	</ul>

	<p>When
		using


		<b>may/might
			have</b>


		,
		we are making a guess about a situation:


	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>I
				might have left the car keys at the restaurant.


				<i>
					(= It&rsquo;s probable that I&rsquo;ve left the keys there but they
					might be somewhere else too.)</i>

				<br />
				<br />

			</p>
	</ul>
