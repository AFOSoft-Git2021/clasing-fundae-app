    <h1>Phrasal verbs</h1>

    <p>
      A phrasal verb is a combination of a verb and an adverb or preposition,
      which has a particular meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Phrasal verbs are two or more words that together act as a completely new
      word, with a meaning separate from the original words.
    </p>

    <p>Let us take these sentences as examples for comparison:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We have to get the documents.</li>
      <li>Men easily get over certain illnesses.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The original verb &ldquo;get&rdquo; means to obtain something. However,
      when added with a particle its meaning changes. In this case, the phrasal
      verb &ldquo;get over&rdquo; means to recover from an illness.
    </p>

    <p>Phrasal verbs can be transitive or intransitive:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Transitive phrasal verbs are followed by a direct object.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Intransitive phrasal verbs are not followed by a direct object but can
        optionally be followed by an indirect object.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="break"></div>
    <h2>Transitive Phrasal Verbs</h2>
    <p>Transitive Phrasal verbs require an object to complete their meaning</p>

    <p>If someone says: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
      You would automatically think &ldquo;Looking for what? Looking for
      whom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I am looking for my keys.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      My keys are the object (that you are looking for). Now the sentence is
      clear.
    </p>

    <p>We need to add an object to make the sentence complete.</p>
    <p>More examples of transitive phrasal verbs in sentences:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>He&rsquo;s looking for his passport.</li>
      <li>You should put on a jacket because it&rsquo;s cold outside.</li>
      <li>Can you turn off the light when you leave the room please?</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="break"></div>
    <h2>Intransitive Phrasal Verbs</h2>
    <p>Intransitive phrasal verbs cannot have a direct object after them.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My car broke down on the way to work.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Broke down in the past tense of break down. Break down means to stop
      working.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot &ldquo;break down something&rdquo;. Break down is an
      intransitive phrasal verb.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can you sit down please?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You cannot &ldquo;sit down something&rdquo;.</p>

    <p>Some more example sentences with intransitive phrasal verbs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I grew up in New Zealand.</li>
      <li>You are driving too fast. Can you slow down?</li>
      <li>We should dress up for the party.</li>
      <li>Nobody found out that I didn&rsquo;t have an invitation.</li>
      <li>I get up at 7 every morning.</li>
      <li>What time do you think he is going to show up?</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="break"></div>
    <h2>Phrasal Verbs that are Transitive and Intransitive</h2>
    <p>Some phrasal verbs can be both transitive and intransitive.</p>
    <p>
      They can be transitive in one sentence and intransitive in another
      sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      You need to be careful. Sometimes the meaning of a phrasal verb changes
      depending on whether it is transitive or intransitive. Let&rsquo;s look at
      the following example:
    </p>

    <p>Take off (transitive) = to remove something</p>
    <ul>
      <li>He took off his tie when he got home.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Take off (intransitive) = to leave the ground and begin to fly</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The plane will take off in ten minutes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      *Phrasal verbs are used in the same way as regular verbs in a sentence. In
      addition, we often use them in spoken English and in an informal setting.
      Thus, it is best to avoid using these verbs in formal writing.
