	<h1>PAST PARTICIPLE</h1>

	</p>
	<p>In
		English grammar, the past participle refers to an action that was
		started and completed entirely in the past. It is the third principal
		part of a verb, created by adding -ed, -d, or -t to the base form of
		a regular verb.&nbsp;</p>

	<br />

	<p>The
		past participle is generally used with an auxiliary (or helping)
		verb&mdash;has, have, or had&mdash;to express the perfect aspect, a
		verb construction that describes events occurring in the past that
		are linked to a later time, usually the present.&nbsp;</p>
	<br /> </p>
	<p>In
		addition to the perfect aspect (or perfect tense), the past
		participle can be used in a passive voice or as an adjective.</p>

	<br />

	</p>
	<h2>
		Past Participles of Regular Verbs</h2>

	<br />

	</p>
	<p>To
		understand past participles, you first need to know how to make a
		verb past tense. To do so, add -ed, -d, or -t, as in these examples
		that show the verb on the left and the simple past tense on the
		right:</p>

	<br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Jump&gt; jumped</b>
		<li>
			<b>Sleep&gt; slept</b>
		<li>
			<b>Touch&gt; touched</b>
	</ul>

		<br />

	</p>
	<p>Turning
		these verbs into past participles is also simple: Make the verb past
		tense and precede it with an auxiliary verb, as in these examples
		that list the simple past on the left and the past participle on the
		right:</p>
	<br />

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Jump
				&gt; have jumped</b>
		<li>
			<b>Sleep
				&gt; have slept</b>
		<li>
			<b>Touch
				&gt; have touched</b>
	</ul>

		<br />

	</p>
	<p>Though
		they may seem similar, there is a difference between the regular past
		tense and past participle. The regular past has only one part while
		the past participle always has two or more parts and generally
		requires an auxiliary verb. An example of a sentence with a regular
		verb would be: &quot;I helped my friend.&quot; You helped your friend
		at some time in the past, but you might continue to help her at some
		point in the future.</p>
