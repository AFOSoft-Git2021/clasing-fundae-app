    <h1>Adverbs of Place</h1>

    <p>
      Adverbs that change or qualify the meaning of a sentence by telling us
      where things happen are defined as adverbs of place. Some instructors
      refer to these words or phrases as spatial adverbs. No matter what they
      are called, these adverbs always answer one important question: Where?
    </p>

    <h2>Adverb or preposition</h2>
    <p>
      Some adverbs of place also function as prepositions. For example, the
      adverb &lsquo;down&rsquo; can be a preposition and an adverb. Its place in
      the sentence tells us if &lsquo;down&rsquo; is functioning as a
      preposition or as an adverb. Remember that the adverb is placed after the
      verb and describes how it is done. Whereas the preposition is put before a
      noun and is not used to describe the verb.
    </p>

    <p>Subject + main verb + adverb of place</p>

    <ul>
      <li>e.g. She went inside.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Subject + main verb + preposition + noun (object)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>e.g. She went inside the house.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Adverbs of place that are also prepositions include: around, behind, down,
      in, off, on, over, etc. These fall under the category of locational
      prepositions.

    <h2>Indoors, outdoors, inside, outside</h2>
    <p>
      This group of adverbs allow us to describe the location of something in
      relation to a building. When we say something is &lsquo;indoors&rsquo;, we
      mean it is in the house, whereas we use &lsquo;outdoors&rsquo; to describe
      something or someone that is not in the building.
    </p>

    <p>
      The adverbs &lsquo;inside&rsquo; and &lsquo;outside&rsquo; function in a
      similar way. These adverbs can also suggest movement, e.g.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going outside&rdquo; means I&rsquo;m moving from being in
      a building to being out of a building.
    </p>
    <div class="-break"></div>
    <h2>Adverbials of place</h2>
    <p>
      We use adverbials to talk about where something is. An adverbial of place
      is a phrase that functions in the same way as an adverb of place. It gives
      more information about the verb. Example:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Becky was sitting in the garden.</li>
      <li>She put the plate on the table.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some common adverbs of place are used to form adverbial phrases. In these
      cases &lsquo;there&rsquo; and &lsquo;here&rsquo; become nouns.Example:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Over there.</li>
      <li>Up here.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="-break"></div>
    <h2>How do we use them?</h2>
    <h3>1. Sentence position</h3>
    <p>
      a. We usually put adverbs of place at the end of a clause. They appear
      after the main verb. The position of the adverb does not change in a
      negative sentence.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Subject + main verb + adverb of place</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>The man walked backwards.</li>
      <li>She didn&rsquo;t walk away.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>b. Adverbs of place can also occur after the object.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Subject + main verb + object + adverb of place</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>She didn&rsquo;t find the book there.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      - c. An adverb of place cannot be put between a verb and its direct
      object. So we cannot say: She didn&rsquo;t find there the book.
    </p>
    <div class="-break"></div>
    <h3>2. Modal verbs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        With modal verbs, the adverb of place appears after the main verb or
        after the object.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Subject + modal + main verb + adverb of place</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. You mustn&rsquo;t run away.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Subject + modal + main verb + object + adverb of place</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. You should put that book there.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="-break"></div>
    <h3>3. Literary uses</h3>
    <p>
      Adverbs of place are used more flexibly in literary writing (stories) than
      in everyday English.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is to create drama and interest in the story. In this type of
      writing, the adverb can appear at the start of the sentence.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Adverb of place + Subject + main verb</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Inside, all was quiet.</li>
      <li>Nearby, a dog barked loudly.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="-break"></div>
    <h3>4. Word order with more than one adverb</h3>
    <p>
      In a sentence with adverbs of time and place, the adverb of place appears
      before the adverb of time:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>I&rsquo;m moving abroad soon.</li>
      <li>I&rsquo;m taking the dog out this morning.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Here&rsquo; and &lsquo;there&rsquo; - The adverbs &lsquo;here&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;there&rsquo; often appear at the start of a sentence.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Adverb of place + main verb + subject</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Here comes the train!</li>
      <li>There goes Tom.</li>
    </ul>
