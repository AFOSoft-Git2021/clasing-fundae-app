    <h1>So &harr; Such</h1>

    <p>
      So and Such are the two words in the English language which are used to
      emphasize the meaning of the sentence. They are also used to mean
      &lsquo;like this&rsquo;. These words are not the same, because while
      &lsquo;so&lsquo; is used to indicate &lsquo;the extent of
      something&rsquo;, &lsquo;such&lsquo; is used to denote &lsquo;of the
      aforementioned or certain kind or degree&rsquo;.
