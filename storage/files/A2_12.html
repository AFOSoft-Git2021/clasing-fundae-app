    <h1>What &amp; Which</h1>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rdquo; and &ldquo;which&rdquo; are both interrogative
      pronouns. This means they stand for something the speaker does not yet
      know. They work for objects, qualities, or places, but they never work for
      people.
    </p>
    <div class="-break"></div>
    <h2>&ldquo;What&rdquo; Is for Lots of Possibilities</h2>
    <p>
      Use &ldquo;what&rdquo; when there are lots of possible options or when you
      don&rsquo;t know how many options there are. These are a few examples of
      using &ldquo;what&rdquo; in this way:
    </p>
    <p>What color shirt will you wear tomorrow?</p>
    <p>What is your favorite kind of ice cream?</p>
    <p>I didn&rsquo;t hear what you said.</p>
    <p>What makes someone a good friend?</p>
    <p>What did you do at school today?</p>
    <p>Do you know what time it is?</p>
    <p>What is your favorite book?</p>
    <p>What day is your surgery?</p>
    <p>What is your first language?</p>
    <div class="-break"></div>
    <h2>&ldquo;Which&rdquo; Is for Fewer Possibilities</h2>
    <p>
      In contrast, &ldquo;which&rdquo; indicates there are fewer possible
      options. You already know that the answer is one of two things or one of a
      few things. Knowing how to use &ldquo;which&rdquo; in a question means
      thinking about how much you already know. Using it indicates you have some
      background information, as you can see in these example sentences:
    </p>
    <p>Which pair of shoes did you decide to wear with your prom dress?</p>
    <p>Which of your children is starting school this year?</p>
    <p>I don&rsquo;t know which fork is for my salad.</p>
    <p>Which wrist did you sprain?</p>
    <p>Do you know which way we should turn?</p>
    <p>Which day did you decide to host the dinner party?</p>
    <p>Which direction do you want to go?</p>
    <p>Which of these necklaces do you prefer?</p>
    <p>Which museums did you visit?</p>
    <div class="-break"></div>
    <h2>Which versus What</h2>
    <p>
      We use both &ldquo;which&rdquo; and &ldquo;what&rdquo; to ask for
      information, but they&rsquo;re different as they do not have the
      limitations of most of the previous question words (source).
    </p>
    <p>
      The words &ldquo;which&rdquo; and &ldquo;what&rdquo; can help us to get
      answers that refer to times, places, people, and things
    </p>
    <p>What time are you going to arrive? (expected answer: a time)</p>
    <p>Which neighborhood do you live in? (expected answer: a place)</p>
    <p>What is her name? (expected answer: a person/name)</p>
    <p>
      Which theme-park ride is your favorite? (expected answer: a thing/object)
    </p>
    <p>
      The only difference is the word &ldquo;which&rdquo; asks for a specific
      answer with a limited number of options available, while the word
      &ldquo;what&rdquo; has a more unlimited selection from which to choose.
