	<h1>EXPRESSING EMPHASIS: ADDING
		WORDS FOR EMPHASIS
	</h1>

	<h2>
		1. Adding &ldquo;own&rdquo; to intensify possessive adjectives:&nbsp;</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>It was my
				<b>own</b>
				idea, and nobody else&rsquo;s!
			</p>
	</ul>

	<h2>
		&nbsp;2. Adding &ldquo;very&rdquo; and &ldquo;indeed&rdquo;:&nbsp;</h2>
	<p>a)
		&ldquo;Very&rdquo; can be used in an emphatic manner to mean
		&ldquo;exactly&rdquo; or &ldquo;precisely&rdquo;:&nbsp;


	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>...
				and that got me to thinking... How many million people around the
				world were doing that very same thing at that


				<b>very
				</b>

				same
				moment?&nbsp;


			</p>
	</ul>

	<p>b)
		&ldquo;Very ... indeed&rdquo; can be used to intensify adjectives:&nbsp;


	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>I
				don&rsquo;t like adverts in general, but there are some that are
				very,
				<b>very</b>
				stupid and really get me irritated.


			</p>
	</ul>

	<h2>
		3. Emphasizing negatives:&nbsp;</h2>
	<p>a)
		To emphasize &ldquo;not&rdquo;: at all, in the least, really, the
		least bit.&nbsp;


	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Shayla
				is not


				<b>the
					least bit</b>
				attractive &mdash;in my opinion, of course.


			</p>
		<li>
			<p>Her
				reaction doesn&rsquo;t surprise me


				<b>
					in the slightest</b>

				.&nbsp;


			</p>
	</ul>

	<p>b)
		To emphasize &ldquo;no&rdquo; and &ldquo;none&rdquo;: at all,
		whatsoever.&nbsp;


	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>He
				took deep breaths... ragged breaths... and the tears fell until
				there were none left


				<b>whatsoever</b>

				.&nbsp;


			</p>
	</ul>

	<h2>4. Adding
		&ldquo;the&rdquo; to emphasize uniqueness. It is heavily stressed in
		speech.&nbsp;</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Surely
				you are not


				<b>THE</b>
				Paul Newman, are you?&nbsp;


			</p>
	</ul>

	<h2>
		5. Adding question words that end in &ldquo;-ever&rdquo; to add an
		air of disbelief to the question.&nbsp;</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>I
				wanna know


				<b>whoever</b>
				told you I was watching that sort of program?&nbsp;


			</p>
	</ul>

	<h2>
		6. Adding auxiliary &ldquo;do&rdquo; to emphasize the verb. It is
		stressed in speech.&nbsp;</h2>
	<p>I <b>do</b>
		like Sarah... It&rsquo;s only that sometimes she can be a little too
		pushy.

	</p>

	<h2>
		7. Adding adverbs and adjectives:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>I
				<b>actually</b>
				visited Elvis Presley&rsquo;s Graceland.&nbsp;
			</p>
		<li>
			<p>This
				is the


				<b>sheer</b>
				truth, I promise!


			</p>
		<li>
			<p>Small
				families breed pampered children? What


				<b>utter</b>
				nonsense!&nbsp;


			</p>
	</ul>

	<p>With
		non-gradable adjectives (adjectives that express an absolute
		opinion):


	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>I recommend it. We had an


				<b>absolutely</b>
				fantastic time there.&nbsp;


			</p>
	</ul>
	<p>I must confess I found her advice

		<b>utterly</b> useless. e.g.: Her dressing style is

		<b>simply</b>delightful.
