        <h1>If + Conditional sentence (Past tense) + Main
                sentence (Would + infinitive)</h1>

        <h2>SECOND CONDITIONAL</h2>

        <p>The second conditional uses the past simple after if, then &#39;would&#39; and the
                infinitive:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>if + past simple, ...would + infinitive</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The if-clause in a second conditional sentence expresses an unreal present condition or an unreal or
                impossible future condition. The form of the past subjunctive is almost the
                same as simple past tense. The main difference is that for the verb to
                be, the form is always were, (never was) in proper English.</p>

        <p>EXAMPLES: </p>
        <ul>
                <li>If I were you, I
                        would call him.</li>
                <li>If I were a
                        fruit, I would be an apple.</li>
                <li>If my grandmother were still alive, she would be 150 years old.</li>
                <li>If I were rich, I
                        would buy a big house in Florida.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>While the if-clause verb is in the past tense, the meaning refers to present or
                future imaginary conditions. The use of the past tense for a present meaning expresses that the
                situation in
                the if-clause is not real, it is different from the actual present situation. We use the modal verb
                would to
                express the future imaginary result.</p>

        <p> You can reverse the order of the clauses. When the result clause is
                before the condition clause, no comma is needed between the clauses.</p>

        <p>EXAMPLES: </p>
        <ul>
                <li>I would call him if I were you.</li>
                <li>I would visit Paris if I had more money.</li>
                <li>I would give you
                        Zak&rsquo;s phone number if I had it.</li>
                <li>I would swim more
                        often if I lived near a lake.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="-break"></div>

        <h2>HOW TO USE SECOND CONDITIONALS?</h2>

        <p>1. We use the second conditional to describe an unreal present situation and the
                imaginary result of that situation.</p>

        <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>If I had
                        a million dollars, I would give half of it to charity. (I do not have a million
                        dollars.)</li>
                <li>If I owned
                        a white cat, I would name it
                        Pearl. (I do not own a white cat.)</li>
                <li>If I had
                        more free time, I would read more. (I don&rsquo;t have more free time.)</li>
                <li>If I lived
                        near a lake, I would swim more
                        often. (I do not live near a lake.)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>2. We use the second conditional to express an improbable or
                impossible future situation and the result of that improbable
                situation. </p>

        <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
        <ul class="c4 lst-kix_gagiasbm7u1t-0 start">
                <li>If I won a lot of
                        money, I would travel to Europe. <span class="c2 c12 c8">(It is improbable that I will win a lot
                                of money.)</li>
                <li>If I became the
                        president, I would support green energy projects.
                        (It is improbable that I will become president.)</li>
                <li>If I met my
                        favorite actor, I would ask for a photo with her.
                        (It is improbable that I will meet my favorite actor.)</li>
                <li>If I grew wings,
                        I would fly to Singapore. <span class="c2 c8">(It is impossible that I will grow wings.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="c3 c10"><span class="c13 c1 c15 c20"></p>
        <p>3. We also use the second conditional to express an imaginary
                yet possible future situation and the results of that situation. We often
                use this conditional to consider different options for future action. </p>

        <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
        <ul class="c4 lst-kix_lg9jmi58idb-0 start">
                <li>If I bought
                        a bike, I would ride it often.
                        (So maybe I will buy a bike.) </li>
                <li>If we ate
                        all our meals at home, we would save about $200 every month. (So maybe we should eat at
                        home more often.)</li>
                <li>If we hired
                        one more person, we would finish the project on time. (So maybe we should hire one more
                        person.)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>4. We use the second conditional to give advice. This form often has &ldquo;If I were you&rdquo; as the
                if-clause. </p>
        <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>If I were you, I would ask Eva.</li>
                <li>If I were you, I would visit New York City.</li>
                <li>If I were her, I
                        would call Zak.</li>
                <li>If I were him, I would talk to Maria about the problem.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>5. We use the second conditional to explain why we cannot
                do something. The if-clause expresses the unreal situation that is the reason
                why you cannot do something.</p>

        <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>If I had
                        more time, I would come to your
                        party. (But I don&rsquo;t have time.)</li>
                <li>If I had
                        Zak&rsquo;s phone number, I would give it to you. (But I don&rsquo;t have Zak&rsquo;s
                        phone number.)</li>
                <li>If I knew
                        her name, I would tell you.
                        (But I don&rsquo;t know her name.)</li>
                <li>If I had
                        another orange, I would give it
                        to you. (But I don&rsquo;t have another orange.) </li>
        </ul>

        <p>6. We use the second conditional to make a polite
                request.</p>

        <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>I would be very grateful if you
                        helped me with this project. </li>
                <li>She would be really happy if you
                        visited us this weekend.</li>
                <li>It would be great if you introduced
                        the speakers.</li>
                <li>I would deeply appreciate it if you watched our children tomorrow
                        evening.</li>
        </ul>
