    <h1>Would</h1>
    <p>
      Would is an auxiliary verb - a modal auxiliary verb. We use would mainly
      to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>talk about the past</li>
      <li>talk about the future in the past</li>
      <li>express the conditional mood</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We also use would for other functions, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        expressing desire, polite requests and questions, opinion or hope, wish
        and regret
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="-break"></div>
    <h2>Structure of would</h2>

    <p>The basic structure for would is:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>subject</td>
        <td>+</td>
        <td>auxiliary verb would</td>
        <td>+</td>
        <td>main verb</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Note that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The auxiliary verb would is invariable. There is only one form: would
      </li>
      <li>The main verb is usually in the base form (He would go).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Look at the basic structure again, with positive, negative and question
      sentences:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>subject</td>
        <td>auxiliary would</td>
        <td>not</td>
        <td>main verb base</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>+</td>
        <td>I</td>
        <td>would</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>like</td>
        <td>tea.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>She</td>
        <td>would</td>
        <td>not</td>
        <td>go.</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>?</td>
        <td>Would</td>
        <td>you</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>help?</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Note that the main verb is sometimes in the form:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>have + past participle (He would have gone)</li>
      <li>be + -ing (He would be going)</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>Use of would</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Would&nbsp;for the past</h4>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>We often use would as a kind of past tense of will or going to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Even as a boy, he knew that he would succeed in life.</li>
      <li>I thought it would rain so I brought my umbrella.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Using would as as a kind of past tense of will or going to&nbsp;is common
      in reported speech:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        She said that she would buy some eggs. (&quot;I will buy some
        eggs.&quot;)
      </li>
      <li>
        The candidate said that he wouldn&#39;t increase taxes. (&quot;I
        won&#39;t increase taxes.&quot;)
      </li>
      <li>
        Why didn&#39;t you bring your umbrella? I told you it would rain!
        (&quot;It&#39;s going to rain.&quot;)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>We often use would not to talk about past refusals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>He wanted a divorce but his wife would not&nbsp;agree.</li>
      <li>Yesterday morning, the car wouldn&#39;t&nbsp;start.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We sometimes use would (rather like used to) when talking about habitual
      past behavior:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Every weekday my father would come home from work at 6pm and watch TV.
      </li>
      <li>Every summer we&#39;d go to the seaside.</li>
      <li>Sometimes she&#39;d phone me in the middle of the night.</li>
      <li>We would always argue. We could never agree.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Would&nbsp;for the future in past</h4>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      When talking about the past we can use would to express something that has
      not happened at the time we are talking about:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In London she met the man that she would one day marry.</li>
      <li>
        He left 5 minutes late, unaware that the delay would save his life.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Would for conditionals</h4>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      We often use would&nbsp;to express the so-called second and third
      conditionals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If he lost his job he would have no money.</li>
      <li>If I had won the lottery I would have bought a car.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Using the same conditional structure, we often use would&nbsp;when giving
      advice:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I wouldn&#39;t eat that if I were you.</li>
      <li>If I were in your place I&#39;d refuse.</li>
      <li>If you asked me I would say you should go.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Sometimes the condition is &quot;understood&quot; and there does not have
      to be an &quot;if&quot; clause:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Someone who liked John would probably love John&#39;s father. (If
        someone liked John they would probably love John&#39;s father.)
      </li>
      <li>
        You&#39;d never know it. (for example: If you met him you would never
        know that he was rich.)
      </li>
      <li>Why don&#39;t you invite Mary? I&#39;m sure she&#39;d come.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>would&nbsp;for desire or inclination</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I&#39;d love to live here.</li>
      <li>Would you like some coffee?</li>
      <li>What I&#39;d really like is some tea.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>would&nbsp;for polite requests and questions</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Would you open the door, please? (more polite than: Open the door,
        please.)
      </li>
      <li>Would you go with me? (more polite than: Will you go with me?)</li>
      <li>
        Would you know the answer? (more polite than: Do you know the answer?)
      </li>
      <li>
        What would the capital of Nigeria be? (more polite than: What is the
        capital of Nigeria?)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>would&nbsp;for opinion or hope</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I would imagine that they&#39;ll buy a new one.</li>
      <li>I suppose some people would call it torture.</li>
      <li>I would have to agree.</li>
      <li>I would expect him to come.</li>
      <li>Since you ask me I&#39;d say the blue one is best.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>would&nbsp;for wish</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I wish you would stay. (I really want you to stay. I hope you will
        stay.)
      </li>
      <li>They don&#39;t like me. I&#39;m sure they wish I&#39;d resign.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>would&nbsp;for presumption or expectation</p>
    <ul>
      <li>That would be Jo calling. I&#39;ll answer it.</li>
      <li>
        We saw a police helicopter overhead yesterday morning. | Really? They
        would have been looking for those bank robbers.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>would&nbsp;for uncertainty</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        He would seem to be getting better. (less certain than: He seems to be
        getting better.)
      </li>
      <li>
        It would appear that I was wrong. (less certain than: It appears that I
        was wrong.)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>would&nbsp;for derogatory comment</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They would say that, wouldn&#39;t they?</li>
      <li>
        John said he didn&#39;t steal the money. | Well, he would, wouldn&#39;t
        he?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>would that&nbsp;for regret (poetic/rare)</p>
    <p>
      This rare, poetic or literary use of would&nbsp;does not have the normal
      structure:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Would that it were true! (If only it were true! We wish that it were
        true!)
      </li>
      <li>Would that his mother had lived to see him become president.</li>
    </ul>
