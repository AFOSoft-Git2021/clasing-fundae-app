    <h2>Months of the Year</h2>

    <p>
      Every fourth year, the month of February has 29 days instead of 28. This
      year is called a &quot;leap year&quot; and the 29th day of February is a
      &quot;leap day&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
      A leap year has 366 days instead of the usual 365. Most years that can be
      cleanly divided by four are leap years. 2016, 2020 and 2024, for example,
      are leap years.

        the right amount of cold.&quot;
      </li>
      <li>
        &quot;The smell of BBQs and the sound of fireworks speaks July to me, I
        don&#39;t care what anyone says.&quot;
      </li>
      <li>
        &quot;My favorite time to visit the beach is in May, when summer is just
        beginning.&quot;
      </li>
