    <h1>Comparative adjetives</h1>
    <p>
      When we talk about two things, we can &quot;compare&quot; them. We can see
      if they are the same or different. Perhaps they are the same in some ways
      and different in other ways. We can use comparative adjectives to describe
      the differences. We use comparative adjectives when talking about two
      things (not three or more things

    <h2>
      Rules for forming comparatives from a positive form of the adjective:
    </h2>
    <p>A. Most one-syllable adjectives: Add -er to the end.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For example, clear becomes clearer.</li>
      <li>If the adjective ends in -e, just add -r.</li>
      <li>For example, free becomes freer.</li>
      <li>
        If the adjective ends in -y, you sometimes replace the -y with an -i
        before adding -er.
      </li>
      <li>
        For example, dry becomes drier but shy becomes either shier or shyer
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      B. One-syllable adjectives that end in consonant-vowel-consonant: Double
      the final consonant before adding -er.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>For example, big becomes bigger and wet becomes wetter.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      C. Two-syllable adjectives that end in Y: Drop the -y, replace it with an
      -i, and then add -er.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>For example, rainy becomes rainier and ugly becomes uglier.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      D. Two-syllable adjectives that end in -er, -le, or -ow: Add -er to the
      end.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>For example, narrow becomes narrower and simple becomes simpler.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      E. All other adjectives that are two syllables or longer: Add the word
      more or less to the positive form.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For example, acceptable becomes more acceptable and unmanageable becomes
        less unmanageable.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>F. There are a few adjectives that are exceptions to the above rules.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For example, the adjectives quiet, narrow, and clever can use either the
        -er or the more/less forms. However, we never use both forms at the same
        time.
      </li>
      <li>
        For example you wouldn&rsquo;t say someone is &ldquo;less cleverer.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      G. There are some adjectives that are irregular. These include good, well,
      bad, far, and old. Their comparative forms are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>good and well &rarr; better</li>
      <li>
        bad &rarr; worse (Note: The word badder is sometimes used as a slang or
        nonstandard comparative form of bad.)
      </li>
      <li>
        far &rarr; Some style guides may say that farther is preferred for
        physical distance and further is preferred for figurative distance.
        However, these words are often used interchangeably in everyday speech
        and writing.
      </li>
      <li>
        old &rarr; Most of the time, old behaves as a regular adjective and its
        comparative form is older. However, when discussing the ages of people,
        the word elder is sometimes used as the comparative form of old as in
        The elder kitten had darker fur than the younger one. In general,
        though, elder is not as commonly used, and many speakers and writers
        will use the word older even when referring to people.

      Comparative adjectives using less -When using longer comparative
