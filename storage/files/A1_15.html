      Your family members are also called your relatives. You have an immediate
      or nuclear family and an extended family. Your immediate family includes
      your father, mother and siblings. Your extended family includes all of the
      people in your father and mother&#39;s families.

    <p>When you have children, you are a parent.</p>
    <p>If you are a male parent, you are a father.</p>
    <p>If you are female parent, you are a mother.</p>
    <p>If one of your children is a boy, he is your son.</p>
    <p>If one of your children is a girl, she is your daughter.</p>
    <p>
      When a couple gets married, the man is the husband, and the woman is his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>A brother and sister both have the same parents.</p>
    <p>
      One collective word to describe brothers and sisters is siblings. However
      this word is normally only used in written English, not orally
