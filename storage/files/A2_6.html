    <h1>Past simple</h1>
    <p>
      We use the simple past tense to refer to actions or states that happened
      in the past and are finished and completed.
    </p>

    <h2>Rules - You can form the past tense as follows</h2>

    <p>Take the root form of the verb and add &ndash;ed to the end.</p>

      <tr>
        <td>employ</td>
        <td>employed</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      If a short verb ends with a consonant-vowel-consonant, double the last
      letter
    </p>

    <p>
      In longer words, if the last syllable of the verb ends with a

      consonant and then add ed.

    <h2>Negative Sentences in the Past Simple Tense</h2>
    <p>
      When shortening the 3rd person (he, she, it) negative, just remove the o
      in not and add an apostrophe (&lsquo;)
    </p>

    <p>
      To create a negative sentence in the past simple, use didn&rsquo;t (did
      not) + the base form of the verb.
