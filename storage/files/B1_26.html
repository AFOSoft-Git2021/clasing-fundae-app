    <h2>How to use the present tense for the future</h2>
    <p>When we know about the future, we normally use the present tense.</p>

    <p>1. We use the present simple for something scheduled:</p>

    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We have a lesson next Monday.</li>
        <li>The train arrives at 6.30 in the morning.</li>
        <li>The holidays start next week.</li>
        <li>It&#39;s my birthday tomorrow.</li>
        <li>The train leaves at 5pm.</li>
        <li>The course starts in September.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2. Future arrangements or plans can use present simple or present continuous (be +
        verb+ &lsquo;ing) </p>

    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I&#39;m playing football tomorrow.</li>
        <li>They are coming to see us tomorrow.</li>
        <li>We&#39;re having a party at Christmas.</li>
        <li>I&rsquo;ll go to the office next Monday</li>
        <li>I&lsquo;m leaving France tomorrow afternoon</li>
    </ul>

    <p>3. &nbsp;Official reports on TV, radio and in newspapers</p>

    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>

        <li>The Prime Minister visits Paris tomorrow to meet the French
            President</li>
        <li>The queen goes to Australia next week on an official visit
        </li>

        <li>You will only know if you like it there once you&lsquo;re living
            / live in that area</li>
