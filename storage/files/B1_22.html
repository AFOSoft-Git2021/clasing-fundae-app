    <h1>Me &harr; Mine &harr; My &harr; Myself </h1>

    <h2>1. I and me</h2>

    <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo; is the subject &ndash; the person
        who does the action in the sentence. Only use &ldquo;I&rdquo; when you are referring to yourself in the
        subject of the sentence. In other words, you are the one taking action.</p>

    <p>Example- I am going for the dance class with
        Anna.</p>
    <p>Example- I submitted the project a little late.</p>

    <p>Me is the object&ndash; the person who receives the action in the
        sentence. The pronoun &ldquo;me&rdquo; should be used when someone else will perform the action to, or for,
        you.</p>

    <p>Example- My mom scolded my brother and me.</p>
    <p>Example- Minnu is going to cook delicious food for
        me.</p>

    <p>When there are more than one subject or object people do get a little confused ,
        so we will see how to use it correctly</p>

    <p>John and I saw Jane at the party.</p>
    <p>John = subject</p>
    <p>I = subject</p>
    <p>Jane= object</p>

    <p>The teacher called Jim and me.</p>
    <p>The teacher = subject</p>
    <p>Jim = object</p>
    <p>me = object</p>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>2. My and mine</h2>
    <p>&lsquo;My&rsquo; is always used before the noun
        or adjective. </p>
    <p>Example- Arinjita is my
        best friend.</p>
    <p>Example- My book is with Reena, so I need to go to her house to collect it from her.</p>
    <p>Mine replaces the noun. Mine cannot be put
        before a noun.</p>
    <p>Example- Those books are mine.</p>
    <p>Example- I don&rsquo;t like to share things which are
        mine.</p>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>3. Myself</h2>

    <p>&lsquo;Myself&rsquo; is a pronoun which should
        be used when you are performing the task by yourself.</p>

    <p>&lsquo;Myself&rsquo; can be used in two
        situations:</p>

    <p>a. When you do something to yourself</p>

    <p>Example- I accidently closed the door against myself.</p>
    <p>Example- I tried helping myself
        from hurting.</p>

    <p>b. When you want to emphasize &lsquo;I&rsquo;</p>

    <p>Example- I cooked the pasta myself.</p>
    <p>Example- I did my homework myself, so please stop shouting at me.</p>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>4. By myself</h2>

    <p>The word by myself means
        alone. It means when you perform a task or action by yourself.</p>

    <p>Example- As my friends were busy, I had to go
        forthe movies by myself.</p>
    <p>Example- I am trying to solve a mathematical problem by
        myself without anyone&rsquo;s help.</p>

    <div class="-break"></div>
