    <h1>Big Numbers</h1>

    <p>
      Many people find it easy to understand that the number 10 has one zero,
      100 has two zeros, and 1,000 has three zeros. These numbers are used all
      the time in daily living, whether it is dealing with money or counting
      something as simple as our music playlist or the mileage on our cars.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you get to million, billion, and trillion, things become a little
      more complicated. How many zeros come after the one in a trillion?
      It&#39;s hard to keep track of that and count each individual zero, so
      these long numbers have been broken down into groups of three zeros.

    <h2>Writing and Saying Big Numbers</h2>
    <p>
      We don&#39;t normally write numbers with words, but it&#39;s possible to
      do this--and of course this will show how we say the numbers. In writing
      large numbers, American English uses a comma ( , ) to separate thousands,
      millions, etc. American English also uses a hyphen ( - ) to separate
      &quot;tens&quot; words (twenty, fifty, etc.) and &quot;ones&quot; words
      (one, three, six, etc

    <h2>IMPORTANT REMINDERS</h2>
    <p>1. Tens and units are always separated by a hyphen.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>32: thirty-two</li>
    </ul>
    <p>2. You must write &ldquo;and&rdquo; after hundreds.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>156: one hundred and fifty-six</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3. Use a comma after thousands and millions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>3,879: three thousand, eight hundred and seventy-nine</li>
      <li>10,658: ten thousand, six hundred and fifty-eight</li>
      <li>
        2,531,799: two million, five hundred and thirty-one thousand, seven
        hundred and ninety-nine
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      4. When there are no hundreds after millions or thousands use
      &ldquo;and&rdquo; before tens or units
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>9,071: nine thousand and seventy-one</li>
      <li>28,005. Twenty-eight thousand and five</li>
      <li>491,006: four hundred and ninety-one thousand and six</li>
      <li>26,000,025: twenty-six million andtwenty five</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      5. People often say &quot;a&quot; instead of &quot;one&quot; before
      hundred, thousand, etc. and they often add&nbsp;&quot;and&quot; before the
      last number:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a hundred and twenty-one</li>
      <li>a thousand and eleven / etc.</li>
    </ul>
