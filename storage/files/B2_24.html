    <h1>Active voice</h1>

    <p>
      Active voice is the term for a verb whose subject performs the action of
      the verb.
    </p>

    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>John painted the fence.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      (In this example, &quot;painted&quot; is in the active voice because the
      subject of &quot;painted&quot; (&quot;John&quot;) is performing the
      action, i.e., did the painting. So, this is an example of an active
      sentence with a verb in the active voice.)
    </p>

    <p>
      We form the active voice through word order and the use of verbs. The word
      order in an active voice sentence looks like this: subject + verb +
      object.
    </p>

    <p>E.g. &#39;The mouse ate the cheese&#39;.</p>
    <p>The mouse (the subject) ate (the verb) the cheese (the object).</p>

    <p>
      Active voice sentences also contain active verbs. These are verbs in the
      past, present, or future tense that follow a subject.
    </p>

    <p>E.g. &#39;The woman painted her nails&#39;.</p>

    <p>
      Active verbs are opposite to passive verbs, which are past participles
      that follow the words was/were.
    </p>

    <p>E.g. &#39;The nails were painted by the woman&#39;.</p>
    <div class="break"></div>
    <h2>Active voice examples</h2>
    <p>
      The active voice occurs in sentences where the subject acts. This means
      that the subject will come first in the sentence, followed by the verb and
      finally the object. Let&#39;s look at some examples of this.
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>SUBJECT</td>
        <td>VERB</td>
        <td>OBJECT</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>The early bird</td>
        <td>ate</td>
        <td>the worm</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>The children</td>
        <td>ran</td>
        <td>the race</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      The active voice tends to follow a linguistic pattern that is referred to
      as subject-verb-object, this is sometimes shortened to SVO. This is a
      helpful way to spot the active voice within a text.
