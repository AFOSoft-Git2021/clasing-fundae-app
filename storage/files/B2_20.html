    <h1>&nbsp;In order to &harr; So that</h1>
    <p>We use &ldquo;so that&rdquo; and &ldquo;in order to&rdquo;&nbsp;to talk about purpose. We often
    use them with modal verbs (can, would, will, etc.).&nbsp; Both of them are conjunctions that we use to talk about the purpose of something.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>So that is far more common than in order that, and in order that is more formal:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I&rsquo;ll go by car so that I can take more luggage.</li>
        <li>We left a message with his neighbor so
                that&nbsp;he would know we&rsquo;d called.</li>
        <li>In order that&nbsp;you can sign the form,
                please print it out and mail it to this address.</li>

        answers the question &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; We use it to begin adverb clauses of purpose.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;So that&rdquo; can also come at the beginning of a
            sentence but this is rarer and usually sounds stilted to Americans.</p>
