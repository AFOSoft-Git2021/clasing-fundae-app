    <h2>When to Use Cardinal Numbers</h2>
    <p>
      Cardinal numbers are used to count a set of objects and tell us about
      quantity. We use cardinal numbers when we&#39;re counting how many buttons
      are in a jar or how many children are on the playground: one, two, three,
      four, five, etc.
    </p>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Question: How many students are going to the school picnic?<</li>
      <li>
        Answer: There are 20 students that are going to the school picnic.<
      </li>
      <li>There are 3 pans in the kitchen.</li>
      <li>There are 7 items on his shopping cart.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="-break"></div>
    <h1>When to Use Ordinal Numbers</h1>
    <p>
      An Ordinal Number is a number that tells the position of something in a
      list, such as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th etc. This order or sequence may be
      according to the size, importance, or any chronology. Ordinal numbers all
      use a suffix. The suffixes are: -nd, -rd, -st, or -th.
    </p>

    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The cookies are kept in the 3rd drawer from the top.<</li>
      <li>The orange dress is the 7th one from the right.</li>
      <li>The soccer ball is kept in the 3rd carton from the left.<</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="-break"></div>
    <h2>Difference Between Cardinal and Ordinal Numbers</h2>
    <p>
      All the natural numbers are also referred to as cardinal numbers. Cardinal
      numbers are used for counting. While an ordinal number is a number that
      denotes the position or place of an object. Example: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th,
      5th, etc. Ordinal numbers are used for ranking. Here is an example that
      explains cardinal and ordinal numbers:
    </p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <td>Cardinal Numbers</td>
        <td>Ordinal Numbers</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>They are counting numbers that represent quantity.</td>
        <td>
          They are based on the rank or position of an object in a given list or
          order.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Cardinal numbers give us the answer of &#39;how many?&#39;.</td>
        <td>
          Ordinal numbers give us the answer of &#39;where&#39;. For instance,
          where does the object lies in the list?
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Examples are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, etc.</td>
        <td>Examples are 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 10th, etc.</td>
