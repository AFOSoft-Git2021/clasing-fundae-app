    <h1>Daily life</h1>
    <p>A daily routine is a great way to keep yourself on task. The longer you stick with it, the more each task becomes
        a habit, and the less you'll have to struggle with motivation. The hard part is developing a routine you can
        follow every day. Start out with small changes if you have trouble staying on task, and experiment to find out
        what holds you back.</p>
    <h2>9 steps on how to personalize daily routine</h2>
    <table>

        <tr>
            <td>1. Spend a day recording everything you do.</td>
            <td>Carry around a planner, notebook, or mobile phone with a calendar app. Write
                down the start and end times for every activity, no matter how small. At the end of the day you'll
                have a list telling you exactly how you spent the day.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>2.Reduce unwanted activities from your day.</td>
            <td>The goal is to tweak your actual schedule to form your daily routine,
                instead of trying to invent a completely new plan for your day. Look over your list of activities
                for the day your record. Decide which ones you'd like to spend less time on, such as procrastination
                or social media.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>3. Write down productive activities to replace unproductive ones.</td>
            <td>Count the amount of time saved by removing the unproductive activities from
                your day. Write down activities that could fill that time, such as work, studying, housecleaning, or
                other productive activities.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4. Arrange your day into a schedule.</td>
            <td>Using the schedule from your actual day, and the list of changes you'd like
                to make, write down a routine you can follow. You can rearrange activities into any order you like,
                but don't change the amount of time they take. If it took you thirty minutes to have breakfast
                today, assume it will take you thirty minutes tomorrow as well.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>5. Set aside enough time for sleep</td>
            <td>Most adults need 7&ndash;8 hours of sleep a night to stay alert and
                high-functioning. Children and teenagers often require 9 hours or more. Schedule a bedtime and wake
                up time that gives you plenty of sleep, or your daily routine will not be sustainable.</td>

            <td>If your rough draft of a routine is chock full of activity from the moment
                you wake up until the time you go to bed, you'll probably burn out or fall behind the first time
                something unexpected happens. Adjust your schedule to allow for at least one 30&ndash;60 minute
                chunk of free time if possible, and several 5&ndash;15 minute breaks in between productive
                activities.</td>

            <td>Sit down at the end of the day and look at your schedule. If one of your
                time estimates turned out to be unrealistic, allow more time for that activity and cut something
                less important out of your day. If you finished an activity more than 20 minutes early, allow less
                time for it in your schedule. Finally, if the order you did your activities was inconvenient or
                didn't feel right, try shuffling the activities in a different order.</td>

    <h2>Daily Activities at Home. What are some of the daily activities that you do at home?</h2>
    <p>I wake up at 7am every morning.</p>
    <p>I press the snooze button five times every morning before I turn off the alarm and get up.</p>
    <p>I have a cup of coffee and make breakfast. I usually read the newspaper while I have breakfast. My children like
        to have a shower after they have breakfast but I like to have a shower before I get dressed.</p>
    <p>My wife brushes her long hair, and I have short hair so I comb my hair. How do you do your hair in the morning?
    </p>
    <p>It is important to brush your teeth, and some women like to put make-up on. </p>
    <p>After I have finished work, I go home to cook dinner. In my house I usually make dinner. The family eat dinner
        together at 7:30pm.</p>
    <p>After dinner I make sure that my children do their homework, and then I chill out on the sofa and watch
        television.</p>
    <p>On television I usually watch the news. My wife usually comes to tell me to take the rubbish out, or wash the
        dishes.</p>
    <p>Our children feed the dog and the cat before they go to bed and I tell them to go to the bathroom too.</p>
    <p>If I am sick I have to take my medication, but then I get into my pyjamas and set the alarm so I wake up in the
        morning.</p>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>Daily Activities at Work. What are some daily activities that you do at work?</h2>
    <p>I go to work at 8.45am every morning.</p>
    <p>I usually drive to work.</p>
    <p>I always check my emails when I get to work, but I don't always reply to them immediately.</p>
    <p>I take a taxi or a train if I have a lunch meeting. I never take the bus because it is too slow.</p>
    <p>When I am at my desk I usually work on the computer, even during morning tea. </p>
    <p>At 1pm most days I have lunch.</p>
    <p>At 3pm we have afternoon tea, and that is when we usually talk and eat cake. </p>
    <p>When you are in the office you probably have a lot of papers. It is important for you to file your papers,
        and so
        that you can find them again you need to organise your files.</p>
    <p>When I work I have to make telephone calls. If an important issue happens I ask my secretary to organise a
        meeting.</p>
    <p>Once a month I report to my boss, but maybe you have to report to your boss more often. I usually write a
        document that my boss can read.</p>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>Weekly Activities. What are some weekly activities that you do?</h2>
    <p>I go grocery shopping once a week at the local supermarket.</p>
    <p>My family does the housework together every Saturday morning.</p>
    <p>I usually do the washing on Sunday morning and when the machine is finished I hang the clothes out to dry.
    </p>
    <p>On Sunday morning we go to church, and if there is lots of noise coming from next door, sometimes we fight
        with
        the neighbour.</p>
    <p>On Saturday night my parents stay at home and I go out with friends.</p>
    <p>Even my friends that live at home call their parents each week.</p>
    <p>Every evening, I water the garden.</p>
    <p>I usually pay someone to wash the car, but my partner says I should do it, so sometimes I argue with my
        partner
        about that.</p>
    <p>If we are angry at the neighbour, we seek vengeance by annoying his dogs.</p>
    <p>I work in an important office, so I have to shine my shoes each day.</p>
    <p>Sometimes we hire a movie, because we don't like to illegally download music and films. I make sure that I
        synchronise my iPod so I always have new music on it.</p>
    <p>To get our shopping, we go to the mall in the car.</p>
    <p>Last week I forgot to recharge my travel card, and I had to argue with a bus driver. I couldn't call the
        office
        because I forgot to recharge my cellphone!</p>
