    <h1>Transitive Verbs</h1>

    <p>
      A transitive verb is a verb that uses a direct object, which shows who or
      what receives the action in a sentence.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the example &ldquo;she gives a gift,&rdquo; gives is a transitive verb
      and a gift is the direct object (what is being given).
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike intransitive verbs, transitive verbs require direct objects to make
      sense. They can&rsquo;t stand alone with only a subject.
    </p>
    <div class="break"></div>
    <h2>Examples of transitive verbs include:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>buy</li>
      <li>catch</li>
      <li>draw</li>
      <li>grab</li>
      <li>hold</li>
      <li>receive</li>
      <li>send</li>
      <li>take</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When transitive verbs appear in a sentence, their direct objects answer
      the question &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, the sentence &ldquo;Herman buys.&rdquo; is technically a
      complete sentence because it has a subject and a verb. But without a
      direct object like &ldquo;groceries,&rdquo; the sentence doesn&rsquo;t
      make sense.
    </p>

    <h2>How to use transitive verbs</h2>

    <p>
      You use transitive verbs just like any other verb. They follow
      subject-verb agreement to match the subject, and they can be conjugated
      into different verb tenses, like the past continuous or present perfect.
      They include both regular and irregular verbs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The confusing part about transitive verbs isn&rsquo;t how you use the verb
      itself but rather where to put the objects.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the transitive verb does not have an indirect object, the direct object
      comes right after the verb.
    </p>

    <p>[subject] + [transitive verb] + [direct object]</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I brought my laptop to my grandma&rsquo;s house.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Here, brought is the transitive verb and my laptop is the direct object.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, if the transitive verb has an indirect object, the
      indirect object comes right after the verb and before the direct object.
    </p>

    <p>[subject] + [transitive verb] + [indirect object] + [direct object]</p>
    <ul>
      <li>She gave her girlfriend a little smile.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Here, gave is the transitive verb , her girlfriend is the indirect object,
      and a little smile is the direct object.
    </p>

    <p>
      Keep in mind that direct and indirect objects are often noun phrases, so
      they can include extra words like articles (the, a, an) or adjectives
      (bigger, my) in addition to the noun.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the objects are pronouns, be sure to use the right pronoun case: both
      direct and indirect objects use the objective case (when a noun or pronoun
      is used as an object) instead of the subjective case (when a noun or
      pronoun is the subject of a verb).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I taught my friend trigonometry.</li>
      <li>I taught him.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How do transitive verbs work?</h3>

    <p>
      Transitive verbs require a direct object to form a complete sentence, and
      the direct object usually comes right after the verb. Some transitive
      verbs can also use an indirect object, in which case the indirect object
      comes after the verb and before the direct object.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understanding the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs is
      pretty easy to master once you know the basics. To make sure you know the
      difference, look at some examples of transitive verbs in a sentence. The
      transitive verb is in bold and the direct object is underlined in each
      sentence.
