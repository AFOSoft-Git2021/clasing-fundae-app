	<h1>PERFECT CONTINUOUS INFINITIVE&nbsp;
	</h1>

	<p>
		The
		perfect continuous infinitive is a combination of the perfect and
		continuous forms and is used to express a continuing but now
		completed action after a verb which must be followed by the
		infinitive.


	</p>

	<p>
		The
		perfect continuous infinitive is used to express a continuing but now
		completed action after a verb which must be followed by the
		infinitive. The perfect infinitive is formed:


	</p>

	<p>
		<u><b>to
				have been + present participle</b></u>


	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				I'm
				glad to have been living in Barcelona for the last ten years.


			</p>
		<li>
			<p>
				He
				must have been waiting for ages.


			</p>
		<li>
			<p>
				Soon,
				he'll have been running for four hours.


			</p>
		<li>
			<p>
				The
				organizers were thought to have been preparing for days.


			</p>
	</ul>

	<p>
		As
		with the present infinitive, there are situations where the zero form
		of the perfect continuous infinitive is required, so the word to is
		omitted. This happens after most modal auxiliaries, and in other
		places where zero infinitives are used:


	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				You
				should have been studying for your test.


			</p>
	</ul>
