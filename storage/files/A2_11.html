    <h2>
     How to form WH-questions?
    </h2>
    <p>1. with an auxiliary</p>
    <p>
     Wh-word + auxiliary + subject + main verb &hellip;?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Auxiliary verbs are helping verbs (not main verbs).
      </li>
      <li>
        Common auxiliary verbs include be, do, have. Others are will, shall,
          would, can, could, must, should, may, might, etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        What do you do for a living?
      </li>
      <li>Why should we read books?</li>
      <li>When is she coming?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     2. without any auxiliary- (when WH-words replace subjects
        already)
    </p>
    <p>Wh-word + main verb &hellip;?</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Question: What happened to Peter?
      </li>
      <li>
        Response: A bad accident happened to him today.
      </li>
    </ul>
