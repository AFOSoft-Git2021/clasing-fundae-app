    <h1>Wish and the Past Perfect</h1>

    <p>We use wish + past perfect to express a regret, or that we want a situation in the
        past to be different.</p>

    <p>It is commonly used to talk about regrets from the past.</p>

    <p>Use it when you want to express hypothetically a different ending or a consequence of
        a situation that already happened.</p>


    <p>The form: subject + wish + subject + past perfect +</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Example: &ldquo;I wish you had told me before&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Example: &ldquo;I &nbsp;wish they hadn&rsquo;t lost my
            book&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Example: &ldquo;I wish I had studied harder for my Advanced
            exam&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Example: &ldquo;I wish I had brought my camera!&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This use of wish is similar to the third conditional.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>I wish I had studied harder for the final exam. (I studied for
            the exam, but not enough.)</li>
    </ul>
