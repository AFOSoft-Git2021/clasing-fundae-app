    <h1>Reflexive Pronouns</h1>

    <p>Reflexive pronouns are used when the subject and the object of a sentence are the
        same.</p>
    <h2>Singular reflexive pronouns</h2>
    <p>A reflexive pronoun is singular if it refers to exactly one person or thing. The most commonly used reflexive
        singular
        pronouns are:</p>

        <li>myself</li>
        <li>yourself</li>
        <li>herself, himself, itself</li>
    </ul>

    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>

    <h2>Plural reflexive pronouns</h2>
    <p>A reflexive pronoun is plural if it refers to more than one person or thing. The most commonly used plural
        reflexive
        pronouns are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ourselves</li>
        <li>yourselves</li>
        <li>Themselves</li>
    </ul>

        <li>The silly clowns made fools of themselves.</li>
    </ul>
