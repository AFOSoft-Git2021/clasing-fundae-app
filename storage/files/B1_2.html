    <h1>Prepositions of Place: In, On, At</h1>

    <p>
      Generally, we use at, in and on when we talk about the location of things.
    </p>

    <p>at - for a POINT</p>
    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <p>She&#39;s waiting at the entrance.</p>
    <p>He&#39;s sitting on his chair at his desk.</p>
    <p>I work at a bank.</p>

    <p>
      in - for an ENCLOSED SPACE. Basically, when something is inside something.
    </p>
    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m growing tomatoes in my garden.</p>
    <p>I was so tired that I took a nap in the car.</p>
    <p>Marie was born in Paris, France.</p>

    <p>
      on - for a SURFACE. It also means that something is in a position that is
      physically touching, covering or attached to something.
    </p>
    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <p>Please place the bouquet on the table.</p>
    <p>What&rsquo;s on the menu this evening?</p>
