    <h1>Work &amp; Jobs interviews</h1>
    <p>During the job interviewing
        process it&#39;s important to use verbs that precisely describe
        your duties and responsibilities at your present and past positions. The following list provides
        verbs that are both precise and commonly used in an English-speaking workplace. These verbs
        are used to express
        responsibilities and tasks performed throughout an applicant&#39;s
        professional career. </p>
