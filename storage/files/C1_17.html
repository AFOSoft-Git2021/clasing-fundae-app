	<h1>PASSIVE GERUND in the PAST</h1>

	<p>A perfect gerund refers to a past
		action. The time it refers to is always prior to the time the main
		verb of the sentence refers to.&nbsp;</p>


	</p>
	<h2>
		Perfect gerund (passive voice): having + been + past participle</h2>


	</p>
	<p>The perfect gerund phrase, here, is in
		the passive voice. The subject denied an action that he had received.
		In the passive voice, we focus on the receiver of the action, not the
		doer.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>The man denied having been beaten
				in the jail.</p>
	</ul>

	<p>The subject regrets an action that he
		received in the past. The perfect gerund, here, is working as the
		direct object of the verb &lsquo;regret&lsquo;.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>I regret having been sent to the
				new office.</p>
	</ul>

	<p>Here, the gerund phrase is referring to
		a past action that worked out great for the speaker. The perfect
		gerund is working as the subject of the sentence.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Having been fired from the job
				turned out to be great for me.</p>
	</ul>
