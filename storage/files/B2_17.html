    <h1>Adjectives ending in &ldquo;-ING</h1>

    <p>How ING adjectives are formed</p>

    <p>The ING adjective is formed by adding ing to the base form of the verb:</p>
    <p>interest &gt; interesting</p>

    <p>This ING form is called the present participle. We are using it as an
        adjective.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>I watched an interesting film.</p>
    <p>That is a confusing situation</p>
    <p>(Auxiliary verb + Adjective + ing suffix)</p>

    <p>An ING adjective describes the cause of the feeling.</p>
    <p>An ING adjective describes the source of the feeling.</p>
