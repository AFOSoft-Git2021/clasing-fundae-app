    <h1>If + Conditional sentence (Present tense) + Main sentence (Future tense)
    </h1>

    <h2>FIRST CONDITIONAL</h2>

    <p>The future real conditional (also called conditional 1) describes what you think you will do in a specific
        situation in the future. It is
        different from other real conditional forms because, unlike the present or the past, you do not know what
        will happen in the future. Although this form is called &quot;real&quot;, you are usually imagining or
        guessing about the future. It is called &quot;real&quot; because it is still possible that the action might
        occur in the future.</p>

    <p>In a type 1 conditional sentence, the tense in the &quot;if&quot; clause is the
        simple present, and the tense in the main clause is the simple future.</p>

                If clause (condition)
            </td>
            <td>
                Main clause (result)
            </td>

                If + simple present
            </td>

                simple future
            </td>

        <tr>
            <td>
                If this thing happens
            </td>
            <td>
                that thing will happen.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>As in all conditional sentences, the order of the clauses is not fixed. You may
        have to rearrange the pronouns and adjust punctuation when you change the order of the clauses, but the
        meaning is identical.</p>

    <p>Examples</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If it rains, you will get wet.</li>
        <li>You will get wet if it rains.</li>
        <li>If Sally is late again I will be mad.</li>
        <li>I will be mad if Sally is late again.</li>
        <li>If you don&#39;t hurry, you will miss the bus.</li>
        <li>You will miss the bus if you don&#39;t hurry.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to use first conditionals?</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>The type 1 conditional refers to a possible condition and its probable
            result. These sentences are based on facts, and they are used to make statements about the real world,
            and about particular situations. We often use such sentences to give warnings. In type 1 conditional
            sentences, the time is the present or future and the situation is real.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Examples</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If I have time, I&#39;ll finish that letter.</li>
        <li>What will you do if you miss the plane?</li>
        <li>Nobody will notice if you make a mistake.</li>
        <li>If you drop that glass, it will break.</li>
        <li>If you don&#39;t drop the gun, I&#39;ll shoot!</li>
        <li>If you don&#39;t leave, I&#39;ll call the police.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>In type 1 conditional sentences, you can also use modals in the main clause
            instead of the future tense to express the degree of certainty, permission, or a recommendation about
            the outcome.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Examples</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you drop that glass, it might break.</li>
        <li>I may finish that letter if I have time.</li>
        <li>If he calls you, you should go.</li>
        <li>If you buy my school supplies for me, I will be able to go to the
            park.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>We use the first conditional to warn. We warn about a possible negative effect. The person that
            expresses the warning is not the source of
            the negative effect.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Examples</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you sit in the sun, you will get a sunburn.</li>
        <li>If you touch that hot stove, you will burn your fingers.</li>
        <li>If you pull the dog&rsquo;s tail, it will bite you.</li>
        <li>If you park your car there, you will get a ticket.</li>
    </ul>


    <ol>
        <li>We use the first conditional to threaten. The person that expresses
            the threat IS the source of the negative effect.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Examples</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you hit your brother, I will take your phone.</li>
        <li>If you yell at me one more time, I will leave.</li>
        <li>If you grab me again, I will scream.</li>
        <li>If you push my friend again, I will cut you!</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>We can use the first conditional to give instructions. &nbsp;We use the
            imperative verb form in the result clause.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Examples</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If Ms. Carter arrives early, offer her a cup of coffee or
            tea.</li>
        <li>If you have extra time this afternoon, read this article.
        </li>
        <li>If Zak calls, give him the address of the restaurant.</li>
        <li>If you use the dishes, wash them before you leave.</li>
    </ul>
