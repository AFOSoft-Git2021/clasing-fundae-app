	<h1>COULD + HAVE + PAST PARTICIPLE
	</h1>

	<p><u><b>Could have + past participle </b></u>
		means that something was possible in the past, or you had the ability to do
		something in the past, but that you didn't do it.&nbsp;
	</p>


	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>I
				could have stayed up late, but I decided to go to bed early.&nbsp;


			</p>
		<li>
			<p>They
				could have won the race, but they didn't try hard enough.


			</p>
		<li>
			<p>You
				could have completed it sooner.


			</p>
		<li>
			<p>You
				could have blown your chance.


			</p>
	</ul>

	<p>Use <i><b>could have</b></i>
		to talk about possibilities if something had been different in the
		past.


	</p>

	<p>For example, someone who didn&rsquo;t go to college can say: </p>

	<p><i>If I had gone to college, I could have gotten a better job.&rdquo;</i>



	<p>When
		talking about a gymnast who didn&rsquo;t win a competition, you can
		say:


	</p>

	<p><i>She
			could have won the gold medal if she hadn&rsquo;t fallen three
			times.&rdquo;</i>



	<p>Could
		have is often used with
		<u><b>&ldquo;if
				+ had + past participle&rdquo;</b></u>

		<i>(If
			I had gone / if she hadn&rsquo;t fallen) </i>
		&ndash; these


		<b>
			&ldquo;if&rdquo; </b>

		phrases
		express the imaginary past
		situation.&nbsp; However, in
		some cases
		you can use
		have&quot;</b></u>


		<b>&nbsp;
			without</b>

		the
		&ldquo;if&rdquo;
		phrase.&nbsp;


	</p>

	<p>Imagine
		you&rsquo;re driving with a person who makes a dangerous maneuver on
		the road. You can say:


	</p>

	<p><i>Are ou crazy? We </i>


		<i><b>could
				have</b></i>

		<i>gotten into an accident.&rdquo;</i>
	</p>
