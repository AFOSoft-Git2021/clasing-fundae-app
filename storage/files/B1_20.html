    <h1>Possessive pronouns</h1>

    <p>
      Possessive pronouns are used in English to avoid repeating information
      that is already clear. In general it makes the sentence less confusing
      because the same information is not being repeated.

        >Possessive pronouns</a
      >&nbsp;do not&nbsp;have an apostrophe:
    </p>

    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This book is my book, not your book. (Sounds repetitive)</li>
      <li>
        This book is mine, not yours. (Mine and yours are possessive pronouns)
      </li>
      <li>
        In the sentence, mine&nbsp;is a possessive pronoun that replaces my
        book.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the sentence, yours&nbsp;is a possessive pronoun that replaces your
        book.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The possessive pronouns in English are as follows:</h3>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>SUBJECT</td>
        <td>POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>I</td>
        <td>Mine</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>You</td>
        <td>Yours</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>He</td>
        <td>His</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>She</td>
        <td>Hers</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>We</td>
        <td>Ours</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>They</td>
        <td>Theirs</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I didn&#39;t have my umbrella so Marta lent me hers.<br />(I didn&#39;t
        have my umbrella so Marta lent me her umbrella).
      </li>
      <li>
        Her car is faster than mine.<br />(Her car is faster than my car).
      </li>
      <li>
        That food is ours and not theirs.<br />(That food is our food and not
        their food).
      </li>
      <li>
        I know this drink is yours but I need to drink something.<br />(I know
        this drink is your drink but I need to drink something).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Possessive Pronouns Rules:</h2>
    <p>There are two groups of possessive pronouns:</p>
    <h3>Dependent Possessive Pronouns</h3>
    <p>
      My, your, his, her, its, our, and their&nbsp;are the dependent possessive
      pronouns. Sometimes called possessive adjectives, they are used to
      indicate ownership or a relationship. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>This is my</li>
      <li>Is this man your&nbsp;husband?</li>
      <li>Welcome to our</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The rule of dependent possessive pronouns is that they are used before a
      noun. You can think of them this way: they are dependent&nbsp;on the noun
      that comes after them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The possessive pronouns are mostly used to show ownership between a person
      and the noun that follows. However, there are some instances when we
      don&rsquo;t exactly own the thing in question &ndash; people, countries,
      jobs etc. &ndash; but in these cases the possessive pronoun is used to
      show ownership in the sense of a direct relationship
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I love my</li>
      <li>Is Jamaica your&nbsp;country of birth?</li>
      <li>Those are her</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Sometimes an adjective can come between the possessive pronoun and noun,
      but only if it is acting as a modifier for that noun
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I lost my favorite pencil.</li>
      <li>Did you see her&nbsp;blue dress?</li>
      <li>We sat in our&nbsp;designated seats.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="-break"></div>
    <h3>Independent Possessive Pronouns</h3>
    <p>
      Mine, ours, yours, his, hers and theirs&nbsp;are the independent
      possessive pronouns. They are not immediately followed by a noun. You can
      think of them this way: they are independent because they don&rsquo;t need
      a noun after them.
    </p>

    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The car parked outside is mine.</li>
      <li>
        If the candy bar isn&rsquo;t yours, it must belong to someone else.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      An independent possessive pronoun will normally come at the end of the
      sentence or clause. While it should not be followed by a noun, it does
      need auxiliary information before it appears to show the reader what the
      possessive pronoun is indicating ownership of &ndash; the cake, candy bar,
      car etc. For example, if we simply say it is mine, we won&rsquo;t know
      what it is. We will only know whose it is. For us to know what it is, we
      need information before the possessive pronoun appears.
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>Dependent possessive pronouns</td>
        <td>Independent possessive pronouns</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>My</td>
        <td>Mine</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Your (singular)</td>
        <td>Yours</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>His, Her</td>
        <td>His, Hers</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Its</td>
        <td>Its*</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Your (plural)</td>
        <td>Yours</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Our</td>
        <td>Ours</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Their</td>
        <td>Theirs</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      *Its&nbsp;is very rarely used as an independent possessive pronoun. An
      example can be found in Shakespeare&rsquo;s Henry VIII, but it is
      effectively never used in modern English.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, one of the most common mistakes made in everyday English is the
      mixing up of the possessive pronoun its&nbsp;with the contraction
      it&rsquo;s (the shortened form of it is). The golden rule to remember is
      that we never use apostrophes with possessive pronouns.
