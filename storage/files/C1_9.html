	<h1>PERFECT INFINITIVE AFTER VERBS</h1>


	<p>
		We
		form the perfect infinitive with<b>
			to have + the -ed form of a verb.</b>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		We
		use the perfect infinitive after verbs such as claim, expect, hate,
		hope, like, love, prefer, pretend:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				He
				pretended to have lost her number and so had been unable to contact
				her.<i>
					(or He pretended that he had lost her number &hellip;)</i></p>
	</ul>

	</p>
	<p>
		The
		perfect infinitive often refers to things that might have happened in
		the past:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				She
				claims to have met a number of famous people, but I don&rsquo;t
				believe her.<i>
					(or She claims she has met &hellip;)</i></p>
		<li>
			<p>
				I
				would prefer to have stayed at a small, family-run hotel than a big
				international chain.<i>
					(I prefer to stay at small hotels, but I did not.)</i></p>
	</ul>

	</p>
	<p>
		The
		perfect infinitive can refer to something that will be completed at a
		point in the future:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				We
				hope to have finished the building works by the end of March.</p>
	</ul>

	</p>
	<p>
		The
		perfect infinitive is often used after the modal auxiliary verbs
		could, would, might, ought, should and needn&rsquo;t to talk about
		unreal situations.</p>

	</p>
	<p>
		We
		can use the perfect infinitive in a clause with a verb that has no
		subject (a non-finite clause). It can refer to events which did
		happen in the past or to events that might have happened (but did not
		happen):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				To
				have got the job in the face of such stiff competition was a great
				achievement.<i>
					(The person did get the job.)</i></p>
		<li>
			<p>
				To
				have won the race would have been fantastic, but even coming second
				was a great achievement. <i>(The
					person did not win the race.)</i></p>
	</ul>
