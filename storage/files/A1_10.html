    <h1>Basic conversations</h1>
    <p>
      If you&#39;re just starting to learn English, there&#39;s no better way to
      improve your speaking skills than with basic conversation exercises. These
      simple role-playing games will help you learn how to introduce yourself,
      how to ask for directions, and more. With practice, you&#39;ll be able to
      understand others and begin to enjoy conversations in your new language.
    </p>

    <p>
      All you need to begin are the basic conversation guides you&#39;ll find
      below and a friend or classmate to practice with. Be patient with
      yourselves; English is not an easy language to learn, but you can do it.
      Begin with the first conversation in this list, then move on to the next
      when you feel comfortable doing so.

    <h2>Introductions</h2>
    <p>
      Learning how to introduce yourself and greet people both formally and
      informally are essential skills in any language, whether it&#39;s your own
      or a new one you&#39;re studying. In these lessons, you learn how to say
      hello and goodbye, as well as vocabulary that you can use when meeting new
      people and making friends.
    </p>
    <p>SAMPLE CONVERSATION:</p>
    <p>Peter: Hello.</p>
    <p>Jane: Hi!</p>
    <p>Peter: My name is Peter. What&#39;s your name?</p>
    <p>Jane: My name is Jane. Nice to meet you.</p>
    <p>Peter: It&#39;s a pleasure. This is a great party!</p>
    <p>Jane: Yes, it is. Where are you from?</p>
    <p>Peter: I&#39;m from Amsterdam.</p>
    <p>Jane: Amsterdam? Are you German?</p>
    <p>Peter: No, I&#39;m not German. I&#39;m Dutch.</p>
    <p>Jane: Oh, you&#39;re Dutch. Sorry about that.</p>
    <p>Peter: That&#39;s OK. Where are you from?</p>
    <p>Jane: I&#39;m from London, but I&#39;m not British.</p>
    <p>Peter: No, what are you?</p>
    <p>Jane: Well, my parents were Spanish, so I&#39;m Spanish, too.</p>
    <p>Peter: That&#39;s very interesting. Spain is a beautiful country.</p>
    <p>Jane: Thank you. It is a wonderful place.</p>

    <h3>Telling the Time and Using Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      Even if you&#39;re just visiting an English-speaking country for a few
      days, knowing how to tell the time is important. This role-playing
      exercise teaches you the right phrases to ask a stranger what time it is.
      And if you&#39;re going to tell time, you&#39;ll also need to know how to
      express numbers in English. This article will help you out with all kinds
      of numbers, including weights, distance, decimals, and more. Finally, when
      expressing quantities, English uses either much or many, depending on
      whether the noun is countable or non-countable.
    </p>

    <p>SAMPLE CONVERSATION:</p>
    <p>Jane: Could you tell me the time, please?</p>
    <p>Steve: Certainly. It&#39;s 3 P.M.</p>
    <p>Jane: That late? I thought it was early afternoon still.</p>
    <p>Steve: Time flies when you are busy. Did you enjoy your morning?</p>
    <p>Jane: I did, but now I have to rush in order to get home before dusk.</p>
    <p>
      Steve: Have a good evening. See you back here tomorrow bright and early!
    </p>
    <p>Jane: Yes! I&#39;ll arrive by dawn or shortly thereafter.</p>

    <h3>Speaking on the Phone</h3>
    <p>
      Phone calls can be challenging for people who don&#39;t speak English
      well. Improve your telephone skills with this exercise and vocabulary
      quiz. Learn how to make travel arrangements and how to make purchases over
      the phone, plus other important words. Best of all, you&#39;ll use the
      conversation skills you learned in the other lessons here.
    </p>
    <p>SAMPLE CONVERSATION:</p>

    </p>

      Receptionist: Hold the line a moment, I&#39;ll check if she is in her
      office.
    </p>
    <p>Caller: Thank you.</p>
    <p>
      Receptionist: (after a moment) Yes, Ms. Sunshine is in. I&#39;ll put you
      through.
    </p>
    <p>Ms. Sunshine: Hello, this is Ms. Sunshine. How can I help you?</p>
    <p>
      Caller: Hello, my name is [your name], and I&#39;m calling to inquire
      about the position advertised on JobSearch.com.
    </p>

      number, please?

    <h3>Shopping for Clothing</h3>

      Everyone loves to go shopping for new clothes, especially if you&#39;re
      visiting a foreign country. In this exercise, you and your practice
      partner learn the basic vocabulary that you&#39;ll use in a shop. Although
      this particular game is set in a clothing store, you can use these skills
      in any kind of store.
    </p>
    <p>SAMPLE CONVERSATION:</p>

    </p>
    <p>Shop assistant: Let me know if you need any help.&#8203;</p>
    <p>
      Customer: Thank you. (comes back) These are great. So, that makes one
      sweater and a pair of grey slacks.
    </p>
    <p>Shop assistant: &#8203;OK, how would you like to pay?</p>
    <p>Customer: Do you take credit cards?</p>
    <p>Shop assistant: Yes, we do. Visa, Master Card, and American Express.</p>
    <p>Customer: OK, here&#39;s my Visa.</p>
    <p>Shop assistant: Thank you. Have a nice day!</p>
