    <h1>Present Perfect Simple</h1>

    <p>To make the positive present perfect tense: &bull; Use &#39;have&#39; / &#39;has&#39; + the past participle.
        &bull; </p>

    <p>Make the past participle by adding &#39;ed&#39; to regular verbs (for example,
        &#39;play&#39; becomes &#39;played&#39;). There are a few verbs that change their spelling when you add
        &#39;ed&#39; (for example, &#39;study&#39; becomes &#39;studied&#39;). </p>

    <p>We also have some completely irregular verbs. </p>
