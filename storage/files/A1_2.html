    <h1>VOCABULARY WORDS</h1>

    <p>
      Vocabulary refers to the words we must understand to communicate
      effectively. Educators often consider four types of vocabulary: listening,
      speaking, reading, and writing. Listening vocabulary refers to the words
      we need to know to understand what we hear. Speaking vocabulary consists
      of the words we use when we speak. Reading vocabulary refers to the words
      we need to know to understand what we read. Writing vocabulary consists of
      the words we use in writing.
    </p>

    <p>The word vocabulary can have at least three different meanings:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>1. All of the words in a language.</li>
      <li>
        Example: New words are constantly being added to the vocabulary of
        English.
      </li>
      <li>2. The words used in a particular context.</li>
      <li>
        Example: If you want to do an MBA you need to improve your business
        vocabulary.
      </li>
      <li>
        My neighbour is a doctor so he has an extensive medical vocabulary.
      </li>
      <li>I&#39;ve just bought a book on the vocabulary of slang.</li>
      <li>3. The words an individual person knows.</li>
      <li>Example: The teacher says that my vocabulary is good</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2 MAIN TYPES OF VOCABULARY</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        A. ACTIVE VOCABULARY - These are the words you know. You do not need to
        look them up. Their meaning comes naturally to you. You can easily use
        them to communicate with others.
      </li>
      <li>
        B. PASSIVE VOCABULARY - These are the words you recognize. You&rsquo;ve
        been exposed to them and may or may not have a general idea of their
        meaning. Often, if they appear in a sentence around more common words,
        you can grasp the meaning.
      </li>
    </ul>
