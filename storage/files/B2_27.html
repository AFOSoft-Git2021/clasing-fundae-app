    <h1>Intransitive Verbs</h1>

    <p>
      An intransitive verb is defined as a verb that does not take a direct
      object. That means there&#39;s no word in the sentence that tells who or
      what received the action of the verb. While there may be a word or phrase
      following an intransitive verb, such words and phrases typically answer
      the question &quot;how?&quot;
    </p>

    <h3>Examples of intransitive verbs include:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>agree</li>
      <li>continue</li>
      <li>exist</li>
      <li>happen</li>
      <li>listen</li>
      <li>talk</li>
      <li>appear</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Some intransitive verbs can have a direct object, but they don&rsquo;t
      need one to make sense. Other intransitive verbs, such as
      &ldquo;arrive&rdquo; or &ldquo;die,&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be paired with a
      direct object at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      It seems straightforward: if a verb has a direct object, it&rsquo;s
      transitive, and if it doesn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s intransitive. But take a
      look at these examples of intransitive verbs in simple sentences to see if
      you really understand.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>She grew.</li>
      <li>It rained.</li>
      <li>The car appeared.</li>
      <li>Joshua lied.</li>
      <li>My store opened.</li>
      <li>We talked.</li>
      <li>The girls sang.</li>
      <li>My teacher listens.</li>
      <li>Her phone rang.</li>
      <li>His grandfather coughed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It&rsquo;s easy to tell that these sentences have intransitive verbs. But
      what about now?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>She grew quickly.</li>
      <li>It rained a lot.</li>
      <li>The car appeared out of nowhere.</li>
      <li>Joshua lied to me.</li>
      <li>My store opened last week.</li>
      <li>We talked all night.</li>
      <li>The girls sang beautifully.</li>
      <li>My teacher listens to our problems.</li>
      <li>Her phone rang loudly.</li>
      <li>His grandfather coughed during the movie.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It&rsquo;s tricky to tell, but they are still intransitive verbs. Adding
      adverbs such as &ldquo;quickly&rdquo; or &ldquo;all night&rdquo; modifies
      the verb, but doesn&rsquo;t change its meaning. The same goes for adding
      prepositional phrases such as &ldquo;out of nowhere&rdquo; and &ldquo;to
      our problems.&rdquo; These parts of speech are not nouns, which means they
      are not direct objects.
