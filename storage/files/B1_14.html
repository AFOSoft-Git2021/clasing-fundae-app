    <h1>May &amp; Might</h1>

    <p>
      The words &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;might&rdquo; have similar meanings,
      but they tend to be used in different contexts in contemporary English
      grammar.
    </p>

    <h3>May&rsquo; vs. &lsquo;Might&rsquo;: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</h3>
    <p>
      Might&rdquo; and &ldquo;may&rdquo; discuss the possibility of something
      happening in a situation. However, how they are used in a sentence can
      vary. One clear way to know which one to use is by looking at the tense of
      the sentence. &ldquo;Might&rdquo; is the past tense of &ldquo;may.&rdquo;
      When deciding which one to use, you can use the sentence tense to decide
      on &ldquo;might&rdquo; or &ldquo;may.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;May&rdquo; is a modal auxiliary verb that clarifies the main verb
      of a sentence. When preceding a verb, it suggests the possibility of
      something happening, but it does not guarantee it as a certainty.

    <h2>How to Use &lsquo;Might&rsquo; in a Sentence</h2>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Might&rdquo; is a stronger word choice than &ldquo;may&rdquo; when
      describing past hypotheticals. It is also the word of choice when
      emphasizing possibility rather than permission.
    </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Might&rdquo; is the correct word to describe past hypotheticals.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I might have messed up my diet last night when I ate those donuts.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Use &ldquo;might&rdquo; to describe hypotheticals with lower degrees of
      certainty.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I might know Japanese grammar better than her.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Use &ldquo;might&rdquo; to express negative hypotheticals that don&#39;t
      come with absolute certainty.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I might not make every shot, but I&#39;ll keep trying.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Use &ldquo;might&rdquo; to clarify a statement of possibility rather than
      permission.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        My mom said I may not see my friends tonight, and I just might cry.
      </li>

    <h2>Getting Permission Using &ldquo;Might&rdquo; and &ldquo;May&rdquo;</h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to asking for permission, &ldquo;may&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;might&rdquo; are a couple of your go-to words. They&rsquo;re right
      up there with &ldquo;can.&rdquo; These words can be used interchangeably
      to ask for permission, especially in less formal situations. However,
      you&rsquo;ll notice that &ldquo;may&rdquo; sounds more polite.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>May I use the restroom?</li>
      <li>May I go to my room?</li>
      <li>May I have more dessert?</li>
      <li>Might we see your map?</li>
      <li>Might she ask you something?</li>
      <li>Might I read that when you are done?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Using &ldquo;Might&rdquo; for Clarity in Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      There is one area that gets a little muddy when it comes to
      &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;might&rdquo; for permissions. That is when you
      use a negative hypothetical situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example,&nbsp;&ldquo;She may not go to the party.&rdquo; In this
      sentence, it sounds like she doesn&rsquo;t have permission&nbsp;to go to
      the party. If you are trying to clarify probability, you will always use
      &ldquo;might&rdquo; instead: &ldquo;She might not go to the party.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>He may not go canoeing.&nbsp;(permission)</li>
      <li>He might not go canoeing. (probability)</li>
      <li>The boy may not go to the lake. (permission)</li>
      <li>The boy might not go to the lake. (probability)</li>
      <li>Terry may not go to softball.&nbsp;(permission)</li>
      <li>Terry might not go to softball.&nbsp;(probability)</li>
      <li>I may not go to the store.&nbsp;(permission)</li>
      <li>I might not go to the store. (probability)</li>
    </ul>
