    <h1>Verbs patterns:</h1>
    <p>
      There are also many verb patterns that are common in English. When two
      verbs are used, it is especially important to notice which form the second
      verb takes (infinitive - to do - base form - do - verb ing - doing).
    </p>

    <h3>Verbs Followed by the Gerund</h3>
    <p>
      Verbs that are followed by other verbs can take either the gerund or the
      infinitive. A gerund is a verb ending in &quot;ing&quot; that functions as
      a noun. An infinitive is the basic or root form of a verb, typically
      preceded with &quot;to.&quot; Understanding how these words function is a
      crucial step in developing your English skills. Note how the gerund and
      infinitive verbs (italicized) are used within the sample sentences;
