    <h1>Geometric Figures</h1>
    <p>Geometric figures can be named as figure or area closed by a boundary which is
        created by combining the specific amount of curves, points, and lines. There are different geometric shapes
        are Triangle, Circle, Square, etc. It is very important that you acquire the necessary understanding of the
        geometric shapes. For example; the common shapes in geometry like are square, rectangle, circle, and
        triangle.</p>

            </td>
            <td>
                A square is a four-sided area which is created by connecting 4 line
                segments. The line segments in the square are all of the equal lines. They come together to form
                4 right angles.

                If we talk about a circle which is another shape of geometry has no
                straight lines. It is rather a combination of curves that are all linked. In a circle, there is
                no angle to be found.

            <td>
                Similar to a square, a rectangle is also created by linking four line
                segments. However, there is only a difference between a square and a rectangle. In addition a
                rectangle, has two line segments which are longer than the other two line segments. So, in
                geometry, a rectangle is also called as an elongated square.

            <td>
                Triangle comprises three linked line segments. Unlike, a square, in a
                triangle, the angles can be of distinct measurements. They aren&rsquo;t always the right angles.
                Triangles are called, depending upon the type of angles which is found within the triangle
                itself.

                Parallelogram
            </td>
            <td>
                A parallelogram is another in the geometric shapes in which the opposite
                side of the shape are parallel. To be able to examine, if the sides are parallel or not,
                you&rsquo;ll have to closely examine the shape. The key property of a parallelogram is that
                parallel lines never cross or intersect each other, no matter how long you extend them. So, if
                you go on extending the lines through eternity and they never intersect each other, then they
                can be called a parallelogram.

                Geometrical shapes are the figures which represent the forms of different
                objects. Some figures are two-dimensional, whereas some are three-dimensional shapes.
