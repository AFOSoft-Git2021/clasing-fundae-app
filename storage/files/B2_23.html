    <h1>Direct and Indirect Objects&nbsp;</h2>
    <p>An objectd&nbsp;is the part of a sentence that gives meaning to the subject&rsquo;s action of the verb.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>dExample:</p>
    <p>dLeila wrote the poem.&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>&quot;Leila&quot; is the subject, the doer or performer,</li>
        <li>&quot;wrote&quot; is a verb that refers to the action,</li>
        <li>&quot;the poem&quot; is the object involved in the action.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Direct object</h2>
    <p>A direct objectd&nbsp;answers the question of who(m) or what.&nbsp;</p>
  
    <ul>
        <li>David repaired his car &rarr; his car is the direct object of the verb
                repaired. (&nbsp;What did David repair?)</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>He invited Mary to the party &rarr; Mary is the direct object of the verb
                invited. (Who did he invite?)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Indirect object</h2>
    <p>An indirect objectd&nbsp;answers the question of
            to whom, for whom, or for what. An indirect object is the recipient of the direct object, or an otherwise affected participant in the event.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>There must be a direct object for an indirect object to be placed in a sentence. In
            other words an indirect object cannot exist without a direct object.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They sent him a postcard - him is the indirect object of the verb sent.
           (To whom did they send a postcard?)</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>He bought his son a bike - his son is the indirect object of the verb bought.
            (For whom did he buy a bike?)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Subject + Action + Direct object&nbsp;(S-V-DO)&nbsp;</h2>
    <p>dSentence Pattern Two includes a subject plus an action verb plus a direct object. In this pattern, the subject acts upon the direct object, or, to say it another way, the direct object is the noun or the pronoun that receives the action of the verb. The examples that follow will make this relationship clear.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the examples, the subject is in boldface,&nbsp;the verb is underlined&nbsp;once,&nbsp;and    the direct object is italicizedd.&nbsp;</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>In bed with rheumatic fever, thirteen-year-old Bobby
                Bowden&nbsp;used&nbsp;his imagination.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>He&nbsp;also heard&nbsp;the radiod&nbsp;from
                his sick bed.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The broadcasts&nbsp;of Alabama footballgames eased&nbsp;the loneliness&nbsp;of his year-long ordeal</li>
        <li>Bowden&nbsp;formed&nbsp;picturesd&nbsp;of
                football plays and touchdowns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Later, he&nbsp;accepted&nbsp;the Florida State University coaching positiond.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Subject + action + indirect object + direct object (S-V-IO-DO)&nbsp;</h3>
    <p>This pattern adds one more element to that of Sentence Pattern Two. That element is
            called the indirect object. The pattern is subject plus action verb plus indirect object plus direct object.
            Many times, the indirect object is found by asking To whom? or To what? after the verb and the direct
            object. The questions go like this: The subject did what to whom? Look at the examples to see this
            pattern.</p>
    
    <p>In these examples the subjects are boldface, the verbs are underlined, the direct, objects are in boldface and underlined, and the indirect objects
            are italicizedd.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bobby Bowden&nbsp;gave&nbsp;quarterbacking&nbsp;in college
                his undivided attention.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>He&nbsp;taught&nbsp;others&nbsp;the game.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Florida State University&nbsp;paid&nbsp;him&nbsp;the ultimate
            complimentd.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
