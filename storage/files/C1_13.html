	<h1>PASSIVE INFINITIVE </h1>

	<p>
		The
		passive infinitive is used in some constructions using the passive
		voice. It is particularly common after modal verbs (may, should,
		could, etc.) to indicate what is possible or what is correct. The
		passive infinitive is formed:


	</p>
	<p>
		<b>to
			be + past participle</b>


	</p>


	</p>
	<p>
		We
		form the passive infinitive of verbs by putting


		<i>to
			be</i>



		(sometimes


		<i>to
			get</i>


		)
		in front of the past participle.


	</p>


	</p>
	<p>
		If
		the subject is not the agent, we use a passive infinitive.


	</p>


	</p>
	<p>
		As
		with the present infinitive, there are situations where the zero form
		of the passive infinitive is required, so the word to is omitted.
		This happens after most modal auxiliaries, and in other places where
		zero infinitives are used.


	</p>


	</p>
	<p>
		There
		is sometimes little difference in meaning whether be or have been
		passive forms are used. On other occasions, be is more clearly
		associated with present time and have been is more clearly associated
		with past time.
