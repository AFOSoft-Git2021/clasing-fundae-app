            earned$100,000 by the time he graduates. </li>

            you have savedfor the down

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h3>Use #2: Describe the duration of an action in the
        future</h3>
    <p> We can use the future perfect to describe how long an action will occur before a
        future time. We may know what the exact time is but it&#39;s not important.</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> By next year we will have lived here for 25 years. </li>
        <li> On June 1st, my parents will have
            beenmarried for 50 years.</li>
        <li> I&#39;m going to take my daughter to the hospital. By tomorrow, she
            will have hada severe headache for a week.
        </li>

            sleptfor three entire days.</li>

        <li> He will have saved a lot of money by retirement.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h3>Use #3: To describe certainty about the recent
        past</h3>
    <p>We can use the future perfect to describe an event that we are sure has
        happened very recently.</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> I&#39;m sure my assistant will have
            finishedthe report by now.</li>
