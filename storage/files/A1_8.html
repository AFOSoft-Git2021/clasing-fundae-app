    <h1>WHAT ARE GREETINGS?</h1>
    <p>A greeting is simply a way of saying hello to someone. In the English language, there
        are multiple ways in which this can be done. There are greetings which can be used in formal situations and
        also greetings which are used in a more friendly, informal setting. It is very important to be able to
        select an appropriate greeting for every situation.</p>

    <h2>TYPES OF GREETINGS:</h2>
    <h3>1. FORMAL GREETINGS</h3>

    <p>When meeting someone under formal circumstances such as in a business meeting or
        meeting an important person for the first time, you might use some of these more formal greetings. If you
        are ever in any sort of doubt as to whether you should use a formal or informal greeting, it is always
        better to opt for the formal to avoid causing offence. If the situation calls for an informal greeting, the
        other speaker will likely signal this.Formal greetings are used in certain situations and when communicating
        with certain types of people to show respect or to maintain a professional tone in the interaction.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>a. Good morning/afternoon/evening/day &ndash; These formal greetings
            are used as a replacement for the word &lsquo;hello&rsquo; and are often used in a formal setting
            depending on the time of day. Usually, before 12 pm, you say &lsquo;good morning,&rsquo; after 12 pm you
            say &lsquo;good afternoon&lsquo; and from around 6 pm you say &lsquo;good evening.&rsquo; You can use
            the term &lsquo;good day&rsquo; at any point during the morning or afternoon.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Good morning Mr. Johnson</li>
            <li>Good afternoon Miss Jackson</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
        <li>b. How do you do? &ndash; This is quite an old-fashioned greeting,
            but it is still widely used in very formal situations. You are likely to hear a reply such as
            &lsquo;very well, thank you&rsquo; when asking this question.
        </li>
        <li>c. Pleased to meet you &ndash; This is a greeting which is often
            used when meeting someone for the first time. It is common in formal circumstances but may also be used
            in a less formal situation on a first meeting.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A: &ldquo;Good morning. How do you do? I&rsquo;m Josef Rammas
                with X Company.&rdquo;
            </li>
            <li>
                B: &ldquo;Pleased to meet you Mr. Rammas.&rdquo;
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>   
    
    <ul>
        <li>d. How are you doing? &ndash; This is a polite way of asking how
            someone is and is often used in conjunction with words like &lsquo;hello&rsquo; or &lsquo;good
            morning/afternoon/evening&rsquo; etc.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>A: Hello! Good to see you, sir.</li>
            <li>B: Same here, Joseph. How are you doing?</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. INFORMAL GREETINGS</h2>
    <p>There are many more informal greetings in English than there are formal ones and this
        is because most situations call for a more laid back tone. We are now going to take a look at some informal
        greetings which you can use with English speaking friends, family or anyone else that you are familiar
        with.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>a. Hi &ndash; This word, which is another word for
            &lsquo;hello&lsquo; is probably one of the most commonly used greetings in the English language and
            something you will hear very frequently.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Hi, Lara.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>    
    
    <ul>
        <li>b. What&rsquo;s up? / What&rsquo;s new? &ndash; his is a common,
            informal way of say &ldquo;hi&rdquo; and &ldquo;how are you.&rdquo; For &ldquo;what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;
            &ndash; in pronunciation and informal spelling (for example in texting or an informal email between
            friends.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Hey Mina, what&rsquo;s up?</li>
            <li>Oh, hey. Not much. How&rsquo;s it going?</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>    
    
    <ul>
        <li>c. Hey (there!) &ndash; Another variation on the word
            &lsquo;hello&rsquo;. this is used as a friendly, upbeat greeting.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Hey man!</li>
            <li>Hey there everyone.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>    
    
    <ul>
        <li>d. How&rsquo;s it going? -This is an informal way to ask someone how
            they are and is used often in place of &lsquo;hello.&rsquo;
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Hey Dawn, good to see you! How&rsquo;s it going?</li>
            <li><span>Hey there! How&rsquo;s it going?</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>    

    <div class="-break"></div>
    
    <h2>WHAT ARE FAREWELLS?</h2>
    <p>A farewell is also an expression of good wishes at a parting. If you&rsquo;re leaving a job
            after being there a long time, your co-workers might throw you a farewell party. Farewell is an expression,
            like &quot;goodbye,&quot; but also a noun &mdash; if you like to leave without a lot of fuss, you
            don&rsquo;t like long farewells. Farewell is a combination of fare and well. Fare comes from the Old English
            word faran, which means &quot;to journey.&quot;
    </p>

    <h3>TYPES OF FARWELLS</h3>

    <p>1. FORMAL FAREWELLS</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a. Goodbye - This greeting is one of the least widespread and is
            also among the most formal. It is generally used when one thinks that they will not see the other person
            again.
        </li>
        <li>b. Farewell -This is a very formal greeting that has practically
            fallen into disuse. It is composed of the verb fare (to happen) and well (good). Therefore, it
            represents a desire for good things to happen. As in the case of goodbye, it is used only in cases where
            it is believed that you will not meet again. However, it has a more romantic and archaic tone than
            goodbye.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>A: &ldquo;Safe travels. Farewell.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>B:&ldquo;Thank you. Goodbye.&rdquo;</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>   

    <ul>
        <li>c. Have a good day - Literally meaning what it says, this a pretty
            formal farewell and, along with the corresponding expressions have a nice evening, have a good night,
            have a nice day, it is appropriate to take leave of someone you do not know well. In fact, we can adapt
            this formula to the situation by wishing someone a good holiday, a good weekend, etc.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
        <li>d. Take care - Less formal than the previous example, this means
            &ldquo;take care of yourself&rdquo; and is used when we think that we will not see the person we are
            speaking to for some time.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>A: &ldquo;Have fun and take care.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>B: &ldquo;Thank you, I will.&rdquo;</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
        
    <ul>
        <li>e. It was nice seeing you - Just as we say &ldquo;Nice to see
            you&rdquo; when we come across someone we know, we can use this form of farewell to reiterate the
            pleasure of seeing someone. If, on the other hand, we have just met someone for the first time, we could
            say &ldquo;It was nice meeting you.&rdquo;
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>2. INFORMAL FAREWELLS</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>a. Bye - This is the most popular and common farewell. It is quite
            informal but can be addressed to people we know as well as to those we are meeting for the first time or
            accidentally.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>A:See you later.</li>
            <li>B:OK. Bye.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>   
    
    <ul>
        <li>b. Bye bye! - Usually, this farewell is used when addressing
            children. If it is exchanged between adults, it may sound childish or malicious.
        </li>
        <li>c. See you later - Meaning what it says, this farewell is suitable
            for any type of relationship between speakers.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>A:&ldquo;I need to go home now. See you later.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>B: &ldquo;Bye. See you later.&rdquo;</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
        <li>d. Until&hellip; - Use this farewell if you know exactly when you
            will see your interlocutor,
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>&ldquo;Until Saturday,&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;Until next month,&rdquo;</li>
        </ul>
