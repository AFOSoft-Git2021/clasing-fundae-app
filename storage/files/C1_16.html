	<h1>PASSIVE GERUND in the PRESENT</h1>

	<p>
		A
		simple gerund or gerund phrase refers to the present time or a time
		that is close to the time shown by the main verb.


	</p>


	<p>
		In
		the passive voice, the focus is on the receiver of the action, not
		the doer.


	</p>


	</p>
	<h2>Simple gerund (passive voice): Being + past participle</h2>


	<p>
		A
		simple gerund usually refers to the present time, but it can also be
		used to refer to the past in the right context. In the last example,
		the gerund is referring to an event in the past. But note that we use
		the perfect form of a gerund to refer to past
		actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				We
				love being challenged.&nbsp;


			</p>
		<li>
			<p>
				I
				don&rsquo;t care about being liked by others.&nbsp;


			</p>
		<li>
			<p>
				Being
				liked and loved by everyone does make you feel good.&nbsp;&nbsp;


			</p>
	</ul>


	</p>
	<p>
		In
		the sentence below, I love an action that my mother performs on me.
		The passive gerund is the object of the verb

		<i>love</i>.
		You can love doing something too (active voice), but here, I love an
		action that I receive. It can be written as follows:


		<i>I love that my mother calls me Babu</i>.


	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				<i>I love being called Babu by my mother.</i>


			</p>
	</ul>


	</p>
	<p>
		My
		parents didn&rsquo;t appreciate what? They didn&rsquo;t appreciate an
		action someone performed upon them (receiving an action). This can be
		written as follows too: My parents didn&rsquo;t appreciate that
		someone questioned them.


	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				<i>My parents didn&rsquo;t appreciate being questioned.&nbsp;</i>


			</p>
	</ul>
