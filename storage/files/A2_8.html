    <h1>Do and Does</h1>
    <p>
      Do and does are used when we want to ask yes/no questions. We use do or
      does depending on the subject. Below are two sentences with two different
      subjects, she and you.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does she like sport? Yes, she does.</li>
      <li>Do you like sport? Yes, I do.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Do - is used for plural subjects like &ldquo;you,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;they,&rdquo; &ldquo;these,&rdquo; &ldquo;those,&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;John and I,&rdquo; as well as with &ldquo;I.&rdquo; It is also used
      to form imperative sentences, or commands.
    </p>
    <p>I want to do my best in this race.</p>
    <p>That does not make any sense.</p>
    <p>We do not care about imaginary creatures.</p>
    <p>I do love a good comedy.</p>
    <p>They can do better than that.</p>
    <p>Do your homework.</p>
    <p>He believed he could do it.</p>
    <p>The machine does everything for us.</p>
    <p>If you do what I tell you, it will be fine.</p>
    <p>Jack and Jill do whatever they want on Tuesdays.</p>
    <p>They do not like snakes.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ll just do my hair and then I&rsquo;ll be ready.</p>
    <p>I do play football.</p>

    <p>
      Does - is used for singular subjects like &ldquo;he,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;she,&rdquo; &ldquo;it,&rdquo; &ldquo;this,&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;that&rdquo;. It is never used to form imperative sentences.
    </p>

    <p>She does her exams every Summer.</p>
    <p>He does a good job cleaning his room.</p>
    <p>It does not sound good.</p>
    <p>John does his laundry on Sundays.</p>
    <p>That does not look fun.</p>
    <p>This does sound good!</p>
    <p>John does not like snakes</p>
    <p>Pete always does his taxes on time.</p>
    <p>She does look so tired!</p>
    <p>She does accounting for the firm.</p>

    <h3>NOTES:</h3>
    <p>
      The main difference between Do and Does is that do is used as an auxiliary
      verb in simple present sentences with first person singular and plural,
      second person singular and plural as well as third-person plural nouns
      whereas does is used with only third-person singular nouns.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a sentence, do is used with first-person singular, first-person plural,
      second person singular and second person plural, and third-person plural
      nouns. Does is only used with third person singular nouns. Does is nothing
      but a conjugal form of &lsquo;do&rsquo; using with the same meaning with
      an added &lsquo;-es&rsquo;.
    </p>

    <p>
      The usage of do as a major verb in a sentence in the simple present tense
      is very less. Its main function is to show what or who performs a task or
      a habitual action. The word &lsquo;do&rsquo; can be used as an auxiliary
      verb for making a contradiction in certain affirmative sentences.
    </p>

    <p>
      When constructing a negative sentence, &lsquo;not&rsquo; is added to the
      do and does auxiliary verbs. It is written as don&rsquo;t or doesn&rsquo;t
      for short. In negative sentences, since the auxiliary verb takes the
      suffix -s, the verb should be used simply.
    </p>

    <p>Examples:</p>
    <p>I do not like pizza.</p>
    <p>He does not go to cinema every weekend.</p>
    <p>We do not come in work on Sunday.</p>

    <p>
      In the question sentences of this structure, &lsquo;Do and Does&rsquo; is
      used at the beginning of the sentence. Since the auxiliary verb takes the
      suffix -s in the question sentences, the verb should be used simply.
    </p>

    <p>Examples:</p>
    <p>What do you think about it?</p>
    <p>Do you like me?</p>
    <p>Why do you need it?</p>

      usually answers &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; questions.

      &ldquo;do&rdquo; or &ldquo;does&rdquo; can come after that question word.
