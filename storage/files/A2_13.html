    <h1>Who, Whom, Whose</h1>
    <p>Who, whose, and whom can be used in questions or relative clauses.</p>
    <p>
      Who is a subject pronoun like &#39;he&#39;, &#39;she&#39; and
      &#39;they&#39;. We use &#39;who&#39; to ask which person did an action or
      which person is in a certain state.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a sentence or clause, who will be used as the subject or to refer back
      to the subject in a sentence. In its simplest terms, this means who will
      be the part of the sentence or clause directly interacting with the main
      verb and performing the action.
    </p>
    <p>Who wrote that letter?</p>
    <p>Who is the manager?</p>
    <p>Who is going to prepare dinner?</p>
    <p>John, who got a new dog last week , needed to buy a stronger leash.</p>
    <p>He got a new dog, one who barked all night and slept all day.</p>
    <p>

    <p>Do you have any idea who he sold his car to?</p>
    <p>We have two extra tickets for the concert. who wants to go with us?</p>
    <p>It wasn&#39;t me! I have no idea who left the oven on.</p>
    <p>
      Do you remember who received the Academy Award for best actress that year?
      Was it Nicole Kidman?
    </p>
    <p>
      Whom&#39; is an object pronoun like &#39;him&#39;, &#39;her&#39; and
      &#39;us&#39;. We use &lsquo;whom&rsquo; to ask which person received an
      action.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a sentence or clause, whom is used to refer to the object of a verb or
      preposition. Put simply, whom does not directly interact with the main
      verb or perform the action.
    </p>
    <p>Whom are you going to ask to the party?</p>
    <p>Whom did they choose as team captain?</p>
    <p>Whom did they summon?</p>
    <p>The lady to whom I spoke was French, not German.</p>
    <p>The boys were exhausted, most of whom hadn&rsquo;t slept in days.</p>
    <p>
      James Madison, about whom we speak little nowadays, was a superb leader.
    </p>
    <p>I don&#39;t know whom he invited.</p>
    <p>
      Whose&#39; is a possessive pronoun like &#39;his&#39;, and &#39;our&#39;.
      We use &#39;whose&#39; to find out which person something belongs to.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a sentence or clause, whose is used to as a possessive pronoun. We use
      whose in a sentence to either indicate or to question who something
      belongs to.
    </p>
    <p>Whose phone is this?</p>
    <p>Whose is this umbrella?</p>
    <p>Whose car is blocking the drive?</p>
    <p>John, whose dog barked all night, is loathed by his neighbours.</p>
    <p>Let him whose conscience is clear step forward.</p>
    <p>I have no doubt whose mess it is.</p>
    <p>Whose line Is It Anyway?</p>
    <p>Whose camera is this?</p>
    <p>She knew the family whose house we bought.</p>

    <h3>Who and whom in informal English</h3>
    <p>
      While &#39;who&#39; is is used as a subject pronoun and &#39;whom&#39; is
      used as an object pronoun in conventional grammar, in informal English,
      who is used in both instances, that is as subject and object pronouns.
      &#39;Who&#39; is thus used in informal English instead of &#39;whom&#39;
      in contexts where the latter is typically used in formal English.
