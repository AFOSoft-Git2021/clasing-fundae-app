    <h1>Prepositions of Time: At, In, On</h1>

    <p>
      A preposition of time is a preposition that allows you to discuss a
      specific time period such as a date on the calendar, one of the days of
      the week, or the actual time something takes place. Prepositions of time
      are the same words as prepositions of place, however they are used in a
      different way. You can easily distinguish these prepositions, as they
      always discuss times rather than places.
