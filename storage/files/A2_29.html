    <h1>Courtesy Phrases</h1>

    <p>When learning another language, it&rsquo;s easy to make the mistake of being a
        little bit rude, since you might not be aware of the phrases that are considered &ldquo;polite&rdquo; or
        &ldquo;impolite&rdquo; to native speakers.</p>

    <p>Polite English is especially important if you&rsquo;re learning English for your job
        or career. You want to have good relationships with coworkers, make a positive impression on clients, and
        sound pleasant during interviews.</p>
    <h2>Making a request</h2>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <p>In English, when we ask for something or ask someone to do something, we often use
        the modal verbs like could, might, should, and would to sound more polite. They soften the request and make
        it sound less like you are ordering someone to do something. Examples:</p>

    <p>Could you please open the window?</p>
    <p>Do you think you could turn the music down a little, please?</p>
    <p>Would you mind telling me the time, please?</p>
    <p>Would you be so kind as to pass me that book?</p>
    <p>I would appreciate it if you could&hellip;</p>
    <p>I would be most grateful if you could&hellip;.</p>
    <p>When convenient for you, could you please&hellip;</p>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>Saying &acute;thank you`:</h2>

    <p>If your (polite) request has been met, don&rsquo;t forget to say how grateful you
        are to the person for what they have done or said. Examples:</p>
    <p>Thank you very much!</p>
    <p>That&rsquo;s very kind of you.</p>
    <p>Thanks a lot! (note: this expression is sometimes used sarcastically to mean the
        opposite. Make sure your tone is clear!)</p>
    <p>Thanks, I appreciate it.</p>
    <p>You are so helpful.</p>
    <p>Thank you for taking the trouble to help me.</p>
    <p>Many thanks! (note: this is usually reserved for written thanks and would sound a bit
        odd out loud)</p>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>Disagreeing politely</h2>

    <p>If you have to express disagreement, it&#39;s important to show that you respect the
        person&#39;s opinion and just happen to think differently. Examples:</p>
    <p>I see what you mean, but&hellip;</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t see it that way.</p>
    <p>I understand what you&rsquo;re saying, but on the other hand&hellip;</p>
    <p>I respect your point, but&hellip;</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m not so sure about that.</p>
    <p>You could be right, but don&rsquo;t forget that&hellip;</p>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>Turning down an invitation</h2>

    <p>Saying no to people is not always easy, so the next time you have to refuse an
        invitation, these polite expressions will help you avoid hurting person&#39;s feeling. Examples:</p>
    <p>I would love to, but&hellip;</p>
    <p>That sounds great, but&hellip;</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t. I...</p>
    <p>Thanks so much for asking me, but&hellip;</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t because&hellip;</p>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>Not understanding/asking to repeat</h2>

    <p>If you did not clearly hear what another person have said, you can say
        &ldquo;Sorry&rdquo;, &ldquo;Pardon me&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Excuse me&rdquo;, or else use the phrases below to
        ask them to repeat in a polite way. Notice that it&#39;s polite to blame yourself for not being able to
        hear, even if it was actually because they spoke too softly or there are other loud noises covering them up!
        Example:</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t quite catch that.</p>
    <p>Could you say that again, please?</p>
    <p>Would you mind repeating that?</p>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>Avoiding &lsquo;Finger-pointing&rsquo; statements</h2>

    <p>When dealing with a problem, coming across as rude can just make the problem worse.
        In order to sound more diplomatic and less aggressive, focus on &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;we&rsquo; instead
        of &lsquo;you&rsquo;, which can come across as accusatory, and use the passive voice. Example:</p>
    <p>Perhaps I am not making myself clear.</p>
    <p>(Instead of: You&#39;re not understanding me.)</p>
    <p>My favourite mug has been broken!</p>
    <p>(Instead of: You broke my favourite mug!)</p>
    <p>It was agreed that you&#39;d complete the task today.</p>
    <p>(Instead of: You said you were going to complete the task today.)</p>

                conversation, when clarifying a situation, it is important to use the more formal &ldquo;pardon
