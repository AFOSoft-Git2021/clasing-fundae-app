    <h2>Important words to use with Trasportation.</h2>
    
    <h2>Get In vs. Get On</h2>
    
    <p>get in&nbsp;- For smaller vehicles that carry only a few
            people &ndash; cars, trucks, small boats, etc.. The opposite of &ldquo;get in&rdquo; is &ldquo;get out
            of&rdquo;. When you arrive at your destination, you get out of a car.</p>
    <p>get on&nbsp;- We use these phrases for bigger vehicles like
            buses, airplanes, and large boats, but we also use them for small vehicles for only one person. We use
            &ldquo;get on/off&rdquo; for bicycles, motorcycles, and horses because you sit on top of them. You can use
            &ldquo;get on/off&rdquo; for anything you sit or stand on top of (skateboard, surfboard, elephant, etc.) The
            opposite of &ldquo;get on&rdquo; is &ldquo;get off&rdquo;.</p>
    
    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>Ride, Drive, or Take</h2>
    <p>- We use &ldquo;drive&rdquo; or &ldquo;ride in&rdquo; for the same vehicles
    </p>
    <p>- Use ride for travel on a bicycle, or horse when we control its movements. Use ride
            or drive for travel on a motorcycle, ride is more common. Use ride for travel in a vehicle (car, bus, train)
            when we aren&rsquo;t controlling (driving) it</p>
    <p>- Use &ldquo;drive&rdquo; if you are operating the vehicle.</p>
    <p>- Use &ldquo;ride in&rdquo; if you are a passenger.</p>
    <p>-Use &quot;take&quot; for travel with public transport, we can replace take with
            ride</p>
