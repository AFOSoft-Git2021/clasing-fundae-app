    <h1>Planets &amp; Universe</h1>


    <p>The planet Earth on which we live is part of the solar system. The Sun is a star at
        the centre of the solar system, and eight* planets and other bodies revolve around it.</p>

    <p>The eight planets, in order from the Sun, are:</p>
    <p>a. the inner planets</p>
    <p>- terrestrial planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars</p>
    <p>b. the outer planets</p>
    <p>-gas giants: Jupiter, Saturn</p>
    <p>-ice giants: Uranus, Neptune</p>
