      languages.The modern English alphabet is a Latin alphabet consisting of 26
      letters, each having an uppercase and a lowercase form, and the same
      letters constitute the ISO basic Latin alphabet.

        (including ampersand) and 5 additional English letters: Long S (&#383;),
        Eth (&ETH; and &eth;), Thorn (&thorn;), Wynn (&#447;) and Ash (&#5803;;

    <h2>ALPHABET SONG - &quot;The A.B.C.&quot;</h2>

    <p>
      &quot;The A.B.C.&quot;Is one of the best-known English language alphabet
      songs, and perhaps the one most frequently referred to as &quot;the
      alphabet song&quot;, especially in the United States.
    </p>

    <p>
      The song was first copyrighted in 1835 by the Boston-based music publisher
      Charles Bradlee, and given the title &quot;The A.B.C., a German air with
      variations for the flute with an easy accompaniment for the piano
      forte&quot;. The musical arrangement was attributed to Louis Le Maire
      (sometimes Lemaire), an 18th-century composer. This was &quot;Entered
      according to act of Congress, in the year 1835, by C. Bradlee, in the
      clerk&#39;s office of the District Court of Massachusetts&quot;, according
      to the Newberry Library, which also says, &quot;The theme is that used by
      Mozart for his piano variations &quot;Ah vous dirai-je, Maman&quot;. This
      tune is the same as the tune for &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&quot;
      and similar to that of &quot;Baa, Baa, Black Sheep&quot;
