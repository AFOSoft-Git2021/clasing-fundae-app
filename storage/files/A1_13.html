    <h1>Present Continuous</h1>

    <p>It is also called Present Progressive. We often use the Present Continuous tense in
        English. It is very different from the Present Simple tense, both in structure and in use.
    </p>

    <h2>How do we make the Present Continuous tense?</h2>
    <p>The structure of the Present Continuous tense is: subject + auxiliary BE + main
        verb
    </p>
    <p>&middot; The auxiliary verb (be) is conjugated in the Present Simple: am, are,
        is</p>
    <p>&middot; The main verb is invariable in present participle form: -ing</p>
    <p>&middot; For negative sentences we insert not between the auxiliary verb and the main
        verb.</p>

    <p>How do we use the Present Continuous tense?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Present Continuous for action happening now</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>a) For action happening exactly now.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>I am eating my lunch.</li>
            <li>The candle is burning.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
        <li>b) For action happening around now.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>John is looking for a new job.</li>
            <li>Muriel is learning to drive.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Present Continuous for the future</h2>
    <p>We can also use the Present Continuous tense to talk about the future - if we add a
        future word!! We must add (or understand from the context) a future word. &quot;Future words&quot; include,
        for example, tomorrow, next year, in June, at Christmas etc. We only use the Present Continuous tense to
        talk about the future when we have planned to do something before we speak. We have already made a decision
        and a plan before speaking. Example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I am taking my exam next month.</li>
        <li>We&#39;re eating at Joe&#39;s Cafe tonight. We&#39;ve already booked
            the table.</li>
