	<h1>EXPRESSING EMPHASIS: INVERSION
	</h1>

	<h2> adverbial phrases of direction and place at the beginning of
		the sentence:</h2>

	<p>-
		(intransitive) verb + subject


	</p>
	<p>-
		auxiliary verb + subject + main verb


	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Dave
				began to open the three parcels. Inside the first was a book of
				crosswords from his Aunt Alice.


			</p>
	</ul>

	<p>With
		the verb BE we always use this type of inversion, and we usually use
		it with such verbs as <b>CLIMB,
			GO, COME, FLY, HANG, LIE, RUN, SIT, STAND, etc.</b>


	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Above
				the fireplace was a portrait of the Duke. In an armchair sat his
				mother.


			</p>
	</ul>

	<p><i><b>NOTE:
				Inversion does NOT occur when the subject is a pronoun (In an
				armchair sat she).</b></i>


	</p>

	<p>In
		spoken English, inversion occurs after


		size: 14pt"><b>
			HERE, THERE, BACK, DOWN, IN, OFF, UP, ROUND, etc.</b>


	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Here
				comes Jake&rsquo;s car.


			</p>
		<li>
			<p>I
				lit a fuse and after a few seconds up went the rocket.


			</p>
	</ul>

	<h2>
		In conditional sentences (instead of certain if sentences):</h2>

	<p>Should
		you need further information, please telephone our main office.


	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Had
				you asked me, I would have told you the truth.


			</p>
	</ul>

	<p><i><b>NOTE:
				This type of inversion is typical of formal texts. Thus, don&rsquo;t
				use contractions.</b></i>


	</p>

	<h2>
		In comparisons with &ldquo;<i>as&rdquo;</i> and &ldquo;<i>than</i>&rdquo;:</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>The
				cake was excellent, as was the coffee (or ...as the coffee was.)


			</p>
		<li>
			<p>Research
				shows that children living in villages watch more TV than do their
				counterparts in inner city areas (or ...than their counterparts
				do...)


			</p>
	</ul>

	<p><i><b>NOTE:
				This type of inversion is typical of formal written language. It does
				not occur when the subject is a pronoun.</b></i>
