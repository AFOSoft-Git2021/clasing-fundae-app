    <h1>Alike &harr; Like&nbsp;</h1>
    <p>Both indicate similarities between two things. Additionally, both come after linking
            verbs and the &#39;to be&#39; verb. However,&#39;like&#39; is a preposition and comes before nouns, pronouns, and noun clauses.&#39;Alike&#39;, on the other hand, is an adjective and indicates two things being the same. &#39;Alike&#39; never comes before a noun. So, it is a predictive adjective.

    <h2>Differences</h2>
    <p>&#39;Like&#39; is a preposition of manner&nbsp;and it indicates that two things
            are somehow similar or share some similar characteristics. It can come before&nbsp;a noun, a pronoun, or a noun clause. It mainly
            comes after linking verbs and the &#39;to be&#39; verb.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Look at the examples below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My hair looks like&nbsp;my mom&#39;s, it seems.</li>
        <li>How can anyone feel like&nbsp;I do?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&#39;Alike&#39;, on the other hand, is an&nbsp;adjective. Since it never comes before nouns, it is called an attributive adjective. It also comes after linking verbs. It indicates that two things or people are the same.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Take a look at the examples below:</p>
