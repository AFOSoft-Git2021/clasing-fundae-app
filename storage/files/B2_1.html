    <h2>Main uses of before (earlier
        than) and after (later than)</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Before as a preposition
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>We use before most commonly with noun phrases to refer to timed events:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>I like to go for a run before breakfast.</li>
        <li>You can check in online but you have to do it at least four hours
            before your flight.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We use before to refer to place, especially when it is seen as part of a journey or
        as part of a sequence of events in time:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Get off the bus just before Euston Station.</li>
        <li>Just before the end of the poem, there is a line where the poet
            expresses his deepest fears.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>
            After as a preposition and
            conjunction
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>After means &lsquo;later than&rsquo; and &lsquo;next in time or place&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>After can be used before a noun phrase (as a preposition):</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Shall we have a swim after lunch?</li>
        <li>The bank is just after the park, on the left.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>
            After / Before - Subordinating
            Conjunctions
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>&ldquo;Before&rdquo; and &quot;after&quot; are used to show what happened 1st and
        what happened 2nd. They are subordinating conjunctions, but that is not very important.</p>

    <p>3.1: Action/Result 1 + before + action/result 2</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I brush my teeth before I go to bed.</li>
        <li>She eats breakfast before she goes to work.</li>
        <li>They cleaned their house before they left for their
            vacation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>*We can switch the order of the sentence.</p>
    <p>3.2: Before + action/result 2, + action/result 1</p>

    <p>If we use &quot;before&quot; at the beginning of a sentence, then use a comma
        when writing. We can switch the order of the sentence.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Before you leave, can you check my report?</li>
        <li>Before she left, she said goodbye.</li>
        <li>Before it rained, the sky became dark.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>3.3: Action/Result 2 + after + Action/Result 1</p>
    <ul>
        <li>She ate dinner after she exercised.</li>
        <li>We left the office after we finished all of our work.
        </li>
        <li>I will call you after I arrive.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>3.4: After + action/result 2, + action/result 1</p>

    <p>If we use &quot;after&quot; at the beginning of a sentence, then use a comma when
        writing.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>After you finish, call me.</li>
        <li>After they play soccer, they usually get something to
            eat.</li>
        <li>After it rained, the ground was soaking wet.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We can also use nouns or gerunds following &quot;before&quot; and
        &quot;after&quot;.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>After dinner, we went for a walk.</li>
        <li>Before work, I like to exercise.</li>
        <li>After eating dinner, she called her mother.</li>
        <li>She always goes to the gym after work.</li>
        <li>I will give it to you before tomorrow morning&#39;s
            meeting.</li>
        <li>The store will be closed after 5.</li>
        <li>My life changed after reading this book.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are usually a few different ways to say the same thing using
        &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot;.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>She came after she finished her work.</li>
        <li>She came after finishing her work.</li>
        <li>She came after her
            work.</li>
        <li>After work, she came.</li>
        <li>After finishing her work, she came.</li>
        <li>After she finished her work, she came.</li>
    </ul>
