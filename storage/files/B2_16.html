    <h1>Adjectives ending in &ldquo;-ED</h1>

    <p>An adjective that ends in -ED is used to describe: a feeling (or how a person feels)
        or an emotion. It is used to describe a temporary thing. Since only people (and some animals) have feelings,
        -ed adjectives cannot be used to describe an object or situation.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>My girlfriend is bored. </li>
        <li>I am confused.</li>
        <li>The boy was interested in reading.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The ED adjective is formed by adding ed to the end of the verb:</p>
    <p>interest &gt; interested</p>

    <p>This ED form is called the past participle. We are using it as an adjective.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>I am very interested in football.</p>
