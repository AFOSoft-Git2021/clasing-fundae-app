    <h1>Relative pronouns used as Subject, as Direct Object, and as Possessive Determiner</h1>

    <p>A relative pronoun&nbsp;is one which is used to
            refer to nouns mentioned previously, whether they are people, places, things, animals, or ideas. Relative
            pronouns can be used to join two sentences.</p>

    <p>There are only a few relative pronouns in the English language. The most common are which, that, whose, whoever, whomever, who, and whom.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In some situations, the words what, when, and where can also function as relative
            pronouns. Because there are only a few of them, there are also just a few rules for using relative pronouns.
            Keep them in mind as you write.</p>
 
    <ul>
        <li>Relative clauses are typically introduced by relative pronouns,
                and that the relative pronoun can function as a possessive pronoun, an object, or a subject.<br>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>When relative pronouns introduce restrictive relative clauses, no
                comma is used to separate the restrictive clause from the main clause.<br></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>In American English, the relative pronoun whom is used rarely.
                You may notice this in conversations, but it is best to use the term when writing to ensure that your work is grammatically correct.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The cyclist who&nbsp;won
                the race trained hard.</li>
        <li>The pants that&nbsp;I
                bought yesterday are already stained.</li>
        <li>The four team leaders, whoever&nbsp;the committee selects, will be at tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting.</li>
        <li>Spaghetti, which&nbsp;we
                eat at least twice a week, is one of my family&rsquo;s favorite meals.</li>
        <li>Where did you buy the dress that&nbsp;you wore last week?</li>
        <li>The book, when&nbsp;it was
                finally returned, was torn and stained.</li>
        <li>The store on the corner, where&nbsp;we usually buy all of our art supplies, burned to the ground.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Relative pronouns used as Subject</h2>
    <p>Relative pronouns first function as the subject of adjective clauses. A subject is a
            word, phrase, or clause that performs the action of or acts upon the verb functioning as the predicate. Take
            for example the following two sentences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The book belongs to me.</li>
        <li>The book is on the table.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These two sentences can combine into a single sentence with the help of a relative
            pronoun. First, the relative pronoun that replaces the subject of the book in the second sentence to form
            the adjective clause that is on the table. Then, the adjective clauses attach to the noun book in the first
            sentence to form the sentence The book that is on the table belongs to me. The relative pronoun that still
            refers to the noun the book makes is the subject of the adjective clause.</p>
    <p>The three relative pronouns that can function as the subject of an adjective clause
            are that, who, and which.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Other examples of relative pronouns functioning as subjects include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Harry Potter is the boy who lived.</li>
        <li>The department has experienced problems which have delayed
                production.</li>
        <li>The man, who is also my uncle, is a world-renowned poet.
        </li>
        <li>The teacher punished the students that cheated on the
                test.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Relative pronouns used as Direct Object</h2>
   
    <p>Relative pronouns secondly function as the direct object of adjective clauses. A
            direct object is a word, phrase, or clause that follows and receives the action of a transitive verb. Take
            for example the following two sentences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The cupcake was poisoned.</li>
        <li>The wicked queen ate the cupcake.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <p>These two sentences can likewise combine into a single sentence with the help of a
            relative pronoun. First, the relative pronoun that replaces the direct object the cupcake in the second
            sentence to form the clause the wicked queen ate that. Then, the relative pronoun that is fronted to the
            beginning of the clause to form the adjective clause that the wicked queen ate. Finally, the adjective
            clause attaches to the noun cupcake in the first sentence to form the sentence The cupcake that the wicked
            queen ate was poisoned. The relative pronoun that still refers to the noun the cupcake making that the
            direct object of the adjective clause.</p>
    <p>
    <p>The five relative pronouns that can function as the direct object of an adjective
            clause are that, whom, which, and informally who. Other examples of relative pronouns functioning as direct
            objects include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The person whom the committee nominated for the prize already won last year.</li>
        <li>Your son must like the little girl he kicked.</li>
        <li>The glitch, which Espen discovered, is only minor.</li>
        <li>The baby whom her husband watches is their niece.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <h2>Relative pronouns used as Possessive Determiner</h2>
    <p>Relative pronouns fourthly function as the possessive determiner in adjective
            clauses. A possessive determiner is a word that indicates possession of or some other relationship to a noun
            phrase. Take for example the following two sentences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The neighbor is a very nice old man.</li>
        <li>My brother installed his fence.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <p>As with other adjective clauses, these two sentences can combine into a single
            sentence with the help of a relative pronoun.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    <p>First, the relative pronoun which replaces the possessive determiner is in the
            second sentence to form the clause my brother installed whose fence.</p>
    <p>
    <p>Then, the direct object whose fence is fronted to the beginning of the clause to
            form the adjective clause whose fence my brother installed.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    <p>Finally, the adjective clause attaches to the noun neighbor in the first sentence to
            form the sentence The neighbor whose fence my brother installed is a very nice old man. The relative pronoun
            whose functions as the possessive determiner in place of his.</p>
    <p>
    <p>The relative pronoun that can function as the possessive determiner in an adjective
            clause is whose.</p>
    <p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Other examples of relative pronouns functioning as possessive determiners
            include:</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The man whose dog she walks is her neighbor.</li>
        <li>I really enjoy the author whose books were just
                published.</li>
        <li>Mary is the woman whose children play with mine.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
