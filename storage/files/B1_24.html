    <h1>Future Continuous</h1>

    <p>The Future Continuous tense is often used in English as a way to talk about
        something happening at a given point in the future.</p>

    <p>The structure of the Future Continuous tense is:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                subject
            </td>
            <td>
                +
            </td>
            <td>
                auxiliary verb WILL
            </td>
            <td>
                +
            </td>
            <td>
                auxiliary verb BE
            </td>
            <td>
                +
            </td>
            <td>
                main verb
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>

            </td>
            <td>

            </td>
            <td>
                invariable
            </td>
            <td>

            </td>
            <td>
                invariable
            </td>
            <td>

            </td>
            <td>
                present participle
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>

            </td>
            <td>

            </td>
            <td>
                will
            </td>
            <td>

            </td>
            <td>
                be
            </td>
            <td>

            </td>
            <td>
                base + ing
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>In order to form the future continuous tense, we use the phrase will be followed by
        the present participle of the verb. The present participle is a form of the verb that ends in -ing.
    </p>

    <p>For example, the present participle of swim is
        swimming. The future continuous tense is easier to use than the present or past continuous tense, because
        the verb be remains the same regardless of what the subject is. </p>

    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>I will be swimming</li>
        <li>You will beswimming</li>
        <li>He/she/it will beswimming</li>
        <li>We will beswimming</li>
        <li>You will beswimming</li>
        <li>They will be swimming</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For negative sentences in the Future Continuous tense, we insert not between will
        and be. For question sentences, we exchange the subject and will. Look at these example sentences with the
        Future Continuous tense:</p>

    <p>To make the future continuous tense negative, all you need to do is put the
        word not between the words will and be. Everything else stays the same. You can also use the contraction
        won&rsquo;t (not &ldquo;willn&rsquo;t&rdquo;) in place of
        will not.</p>

    <h2>Contraction with Future Continuous</h2>

    <h2>When do you use future continuous</h2>

    <p>There are several common ways to use the future continuous tense:</p>

    <p>1. The main reason to use the future continuous tense is to point out that a future
        action will take place over a length of time and won&rsquo;t happen all at once. This is the biggest reason
        we would use it over the simple future tense. Read the following two sentences and see if you notice a
        slight difference in their meaning.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Tomorrow night, the fireworks will shoot into the sky.</li>
        <li>Tomorrow night, the fireworks will be shooting into the sky.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is a slight difference, but the second sentence suggests that the fireworks will
        be exploding for a while, whereas the first sentence suggests there will be only one instance of fireworks
        going off. </p>

    <p>2. Another common reason we use the future continuous tense is to make comparisons
        between the present and the future:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>I may be broke now, but I will be living the good life when I win
            the lottery.</li>
        <li>By this time next week, I will be surfing in California.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>3. We can also use the future continuous tense to say that more than one future
        event will be happening at the same time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When the clock strikes midnight, I will be babysitting in the
            streets.</li>
        <li>I can&rsquo;t help you move tomorrow because I will be babysitting
            my cousins.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>More sample sentences</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I will be playing tennis at 10am tomorrow.</li>
        <li>They won&#39;t be watching TV at 9pm tonight.</li>
        <li>What will you be doing at 10pm tonight?</li>
        <li>What will you be doing when I arrive?</li>
        <li>She will not be sleeping when you telephone her.</li>
        <li>We&#39;ll be having dinner when the film starts.</li>
        <li>Take your umbrella. It will be raining when you return.</li>
        <li>On Monday, we will be hunting ducks all morning.</li>
        <li>I will be shopping for tuxedos for several hours.</li>
        <li>I won&#39;t be going to bed late.</li>
        <li>You won&#39;t be doing much cooking this week.</li>
        <li>The children will not be walking to school when it&#39;s
            snowing.</li>
        <li>My girlfriend won&#39;t be reading my emails anymore.</li>
        <li>They will not be telling us much about next week&#39;s test.
        </li>
        <li>She won&#39;t be planning any trips until after graduation.
        </li>
        <li>They won&#39;t be opening the library until 2:00 pm today.
        </li>
        <li>Will I be reading any novels written by women this semester?
        </li>
        <li>Will he be speaking with his advisor this afternoon?</li>
        <li>Will the pilot be announcing updates during the flight?</li>
        <li>Will we be sleeping in cabins or tents on the camping trip?
        </li>
        <li>Will we be skiing in the mornings and the afternoons?</li>
        <li>Will they be going home today or tomorrow?</li>
    </ul>
