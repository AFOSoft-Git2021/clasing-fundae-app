    <p><br></p>
    <h2>The Meanings of Specially and Especially</h2>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>The terms &lsquo;specially&rsquo; and &lsquo;especially&rsquo; have very similar
            meanings, but cannot be used interchangeably. Moreover, the context can also affect the meanings of these
            words, for example, the word &lsquo;specially&rsquo; is used while referring to a special or unique
            purpose/case, while &lsquo;especially&rsquo; is used to imply an exceptional quality, characteristic or
            case/situation. The latter is also slightly more formal than the former.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Specially meaning &ndash; Special/unique</li>
        <li>Especially meaning &ndash; Exceptional</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Specially, is an adverb which is used to tell you something serves a particular
            purpose. On the other hand, especially is also an adverb that is used to emphasize someone or something over
            all others. These two words are highly confusing homonyms, as people usually do not understand which one to
            use, in a sentence. Read out the two examples, which will help you to know the difference between
            them:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The application is specially designed to track the location of the stolen phone, especially when the phone is off.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>My mom cooked a lot of dishes specially for me, but the sweet dish was especially delicious.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, you might have noticed that these two adverbs are used at different positions in
            the given cases. In the two cases specially indicates &lsquo;specifically&rsquo;, whereas especially refers
            to &lsquo;particularly or before all else&rsquo;.</p>
    <p><br></p>
