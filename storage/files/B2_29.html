    <h1>Direct speech &harr; Indirect Speech&nbsp;</h1>
    
    <p>In a direct speech, we use inverted commas to highlight the exact words of the
            speaker while reporting them.&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>On the other hand, in an indirect speech, as its name suggests, it involves reporting
            what a person said, without exactly quoting them.&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>So, in an indirect speech we do not use inverted commas to highlight the original
            statement of the speaker; instead, it is just reported using its own words.&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at the examples to understand the two:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Direct: Mary said, &ldquo;She is going
                to the US next month.&rdquo;<br>Indirect: Mary said
                that she was going to the US the following month.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Direct: The sports teacher said,
                &ldquo;Run fast, boys.&rdquo;<br>Indirect: The sports
                teacher asked the boys to run fast.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In these two examples, you might have observed that when we use direct speech, we use
            quotations to outline the real words of the speaker. As against, in an indirect speech, there is no such
            thing, as the listener narrates the same in his/her own words.</p>

    <h2>Definition of Direct Speech</h2>
    
    <p>When a person gives a written or spoken account of the speech, by repeating the exact
            words of the speaker, then this is known as Direct Speech. It uses inverted commas to highlight the original
            statement of the speaker, which is supported by a signal phrase or say dialogue guide.</p>
    
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Alex said, &ldquo;I will be there in five minutes.&rdquo;
        </li>
        <li>The teacher said to Peter, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t complete
                your homework, I will make a call to your parents.&rdquo;</li>
        <li>Paul said to me, &ldquo;What are you looking at?&rdquo;
        </li>
        <li>Joseph said, &ldquo;You should give him a second
                chance.&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Sometimes, reporting verb appears in the mid of the sentence:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is that so, she asked, You don&rsquo;t want to come with
                us?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Adverbs can be used with the reporting verb, to delineate the manner in which
            something is spoken.</p>
 
    <ul>
        <li>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t come to your party,&rdquo; Kate said
                angrily.</li>
        <li>&ldquo;I will always be there to help you&rdquo;, he said
                sympathetically.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Definition of Indirect Speech</h2>
    
    <p>Indirect Speech or otherwise called as reported speech is one in which a person
            reports on what someone else said or wrote to him, not using the actual words. The indirect speech stresses
            on the content, i.e. what someone stated, instead of the words that are used for stating it.</p>
    
    <p>The formation of the reported clause in an indirect speech is mainly based on whether
            the speaker is just reporting something, or ordering, commanding, requesting, etc.</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Alex said that he would be here in five minutes.</li>
        <li>The teacher scolded Peter that if he does not complete his
                homework, she would call his parents.</li>
        <li>Paul asked me what am I looking at.</li>
        <li>Joseph advised that I should give him a second chance.
        </li>
    </ul>
