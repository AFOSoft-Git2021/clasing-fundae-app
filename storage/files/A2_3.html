    <h1>Qualifying adjectives?</h1>
    <p>
      The qualifying adjectives are a type of adjective that attributes to a
      given noun one or some set of specific properties, or that in any case
      accounts for some of its characteristics.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>We always use qualifying adjectives before nouns.</li>
      <li>
        Qualifying adjectives stay the same for singular and plural nouns.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>The beautiful houses (plural)</li>
      <li>The beautiful house (singular)</li>
      <li>The big men (plural)</li>
      <li>The big man (singular)</li>
    </ul>
