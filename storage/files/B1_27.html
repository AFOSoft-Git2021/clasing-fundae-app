    <h1>If + Conditional sentence (Present tense) + Main
        sentence (Present tense) </h1>

    <h2>Zero condtional</h2>

    <p>The zero conditional is used for when the time being referred to is now or always
        and the situation is real and possible. The zero conditional is often used to refer to general truths. The
        tense in both parts of the sentence is the simple present. In zero conditional sentences, the word
        &quot;if&quot; can usually be replaced by the word &quot;when&quot; without changing the meaning.</p>

    <p>We can make a zero conditional sentence with two present simple verbs (one in the
        &#39;if clause&#39; and one in the &#39;main clause&#39;):</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                If clause
            </td>
            <td>
                Main clause
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                If + simple present
            </td>
            <td>
                simple present
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

                If this thing happens
            </td>
            <td>
                that thing happens.

                it melts.

                If it rains
            </td>
            <td>
                the grass gets wet.
            </td>

    <p>As in all conditional sentences, the order of the clauses is not fixed. You may have
        to rearrange the pronouns and adjust punctuation when you change the order of the clauses, but the meaning
        is identical. In zero conditional sentences, you can replace &quot;if&quot; with &quot;when&quot;, because
        both express general truths. The meaning will be unchanged.</p>

    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you heat ice, it melts.</li>
        <li>Ice melts if you heat it.</li>
        <li>When you heat ice, it melts.</li>
        <li>Ice melts when you heat it.</li>
