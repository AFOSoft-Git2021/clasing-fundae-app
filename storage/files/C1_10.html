	<h1>PERFECT PASSIVE INFINITIVE&nbsp;</h1>


	</p>
	<p>The
		present perfect is a tense that usually describes something about the
		past that has a connection with the present. It can describe a past
		experience that has importance to now, or it can refer to an action
		that began in the past and continues in the present, or it can
		express a recent action that creates consequences in this moment.</p>


	</p>
	<p>When
		we use the <a href="https://www.wallstreetenglish.com/blog/the-passive-form/"><u>passive
				form</u></a>,
		we focus attention on what or who receives an action (the object). We
		use the passive in almost all the tenses in English and create it by
		using the verb &lsquo;to be&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>


	</p>
	<p>We
		use the present perfect in the passive form for all the same reasons
		we use it in the active form &ndash; to talk about recent actions,
		experiences, and ongoing actions/situations.</p>


	</p>
	<p>In
		the present perfect form with the passive, we always use:</p>


	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&lsquo;<b>has/have
			been&rsquo; + the past participle form</b></p>
