	<h1>Simple Present &ndash; special
		usage of &ldquo;do&rdquo;</h1>

	<p>To
		emphasize the meaning of the verb in the Present Simple Tense, it is
		possible to use the auxiliary verb do/does also in the affirmative
		sentence. The sentence then does not change its meaning, it only
		strengthens it.</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><b>The
			emphatic form</b>
		is constructed by combining some form of the verb &quot;do&quot; with
		the root form of some other verb. This has the effect of emphasizing
		the verb in question calling a greater degree of attention to it.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>You've
		probably used the emphatic form when someone has accused you of not
		doing something. You've probably said for example, that no, you &quot;did
		take&quot; the trash out.&nbsp;</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><b>EXAMPLE:</b></p>
	<p>I love her.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>I do love her.</p>
	<p><br /></p>

	<p>In
		oral expression, the main emphasis in the sentence is on the
		auxiliary verb do/does.</p>
	<p><b>EXAMPLE:</b></p>
	<p>You
		do look nice today.</p>
	<p>He
		does believe you!</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p><br />

	</p>
	<p>Similar
		strengthening can be given to imperatives by adding the same
		auxiliary verb:</p>
	<p><b>EXAMPLE:</b></p>
	<p>Come
		with us.</p>
	<p>Do
		come with us!</p>
	<p>Do
		stop talking, Harry! You&rsquo;re boring everybody!</p>
	<p><br /></p>
	<h2>The structure is:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p><b>present
					emphatic:</b>
				we start with the subject followed by the auxiliary do followed by a
				verb in its base form. In the third person singular, we use does;</p>
		<li>
			<p><b>past
					emphatic:</b>
				we start with the subject followed by the auxiliary did followed by
				a verb in its base form.</p>
	</ul>
