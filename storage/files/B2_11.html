    <h1>Verb &quot;to need&quot;</h1>

    <p>This is a semi-modal verb. This condition is given because it sometimes works as
        a modal verb and sometimes as the main verb.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>As the main verb: (To need something). Need
            is the principal verb in the sentence. For example: &quot;I need some water.&quot;
        </li>
        <li>As a modal verb: Look at the following
            example: &quot;I need to sleep more.&quot;</li>
    </ol>
    <p>(Have to) In this case, sleep is the principal verb in the sentence and needs to
        clarify the intent of the sentence.</p>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>Affirmative form</h2>
    <p>Is not common to use to need as a semi-modal verb in this form. However, it is
        common to use it in sentences that include negative pronouns like nothing, no one, none and nobody.
    </p>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <p>&quot;Nobody needs to know where I came from.&quot;</p>

    <p>Need is placed in the sentence in this form: </p>

    <p>No one needs to read this.</p>

    <p>Pronoun (Negative) + To need + Main Verb</p>
    <p>There is no need to use another modal verb in the same sentence where need is
        being used as a semi-modal verb.</p>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>Negative form</h2>

    <p>Need is mostly used in negative sentences where it is indicating that there&#39;s
        no obligation or necessity to do something.</p>

    <p>To create the negative form, not must follow need in the sentence. </p>

    <p>Remember that its contracted form is needn&#39;t.</p>

    <p>Like this:</p>
    <p>&quot;You don&acute;t need worry.&quot; // &quot;You needn&rsquo;t
        worry.&quot;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;She doesn&acute;t need to leave&rdquo;</p>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>Interrogative form</h2>

    <p>This form is not common and is used when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You&#39;re speaking in very formal
            contexts: &quot;Needthey to join us?&quot; </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Something is necessary or very important to
            communicate.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="-break"></div>

    <h2>When to use &quot;need&quot;</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>To show that there is no obligation to
            something. &quot;You needn&#39;t buy that for me.&quot; </li>
        <li>To express that there is no obligation with something in the
            past. In this case, the auxiliary past verb &quot;did&quot; is used. &quot;You didn&#39;t need to buy
            that for me.&quot; </li>
    </ol>


    <ol>
        <li>To refer to events that happened but were unnecessary from
            the point of view of the speaker. </li>
        <li>The sentence structure for this case is: needn&#39;t
            + have + verb(ed). &quot;He needn&#39;t have worked that much on my
            project.&quot;</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>To keep in mind</h2>

    <p>Most of the time, need is followed by to and
        changes according to its conjugation with person, number and tense, like this:</p>

        <tr>
            <td>
                PRONOUN
            </td>
            <td>
                PRESENT TENSE

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                You
                We
                They
            </td>
            <td>
                need to
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>It is also used when followed by an-ing
        clause or a noun clause.
        In this case, it is required to use the auxiliary verb do or does. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Noun clause:Mark
            doesn&#39;t need a new car.</li>
    </ul>
