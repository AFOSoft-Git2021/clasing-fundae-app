    <h1>Articles: A, An, The</h1>

    <p>
      Articles (&quot;a,&quot; &quot;an,&quot; and &quot;the&quot;) are
      determiners or noun markers that function to specify if the noun is
      general or specific in its reference. Often the article chosen depends on
      if the writer and the reader understand the reference of the
      noun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      The articles &quot;a&quot; and &quot;an&quot; are indefinite articles.
      They are used with a singular countable noun when the noun referred to is
      nonspecific or
      generic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      The article &quot;the&quot; is a definite article. It is used to show
      specific reference and can be used with both singular and plural nouns and
      with both countable and uncountable nouns.

      1. &quot;A&quot; and &quot;an&quot; are used with singular countable nouns
      when the noun is nonspecific or generic.

        </td>
        <td>
          <p>
            In this sentence, &quot;car&quot; is a singular countable noun that
            is not specific. It could be any car.

        </td>
        <td>
          <p>
            &quot;University&quot; is a singular countable noun. Although it
            begins with a vowel, the first sound of the word is /j/ or
            &ldquo;y.&rdquo; Thus, &quot;a&quot; instead of &quot;an&quot; is
            used. In this sentence, it is also generic (it could be any
            university with this specialization, not a specific one).
          </p>
        </td>

          <p>
            In this sentence, &quot;apple&quot; is a singular countable noun
            that is not specific. It could be any apple.

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      2. &quot;A&quot; is used when the noun that follows begins with a
      consonant sound.
    </p>
    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <p>
      a
      book&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      a
      pen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      a uniform - (Note that &quot;uniform&quot; starts with a vowel, but the
      first sound is /j/ or a &ldquo;y&rdquo; sound. Therefore &quot;a&quot;
      instead of &quot;an&quot; is used
      here.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      3. &quot;An&quot; is used when the noun that follows begins with a vowel
      sound.
    </p>
    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <p>
      an
      elephant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>an American&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      an MBA (Note that &quot;MBA&quot; starts with a consonant, but the first
      sound is /&#400;/ or a short &ldquo;e&rdquo; sound. Therefore,
      &quot;an&quot; instead of &quot;a&quot; is used
      here.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      4. Sometimes &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot; can be used for first mention
      (the first time the noun is mentioned). Then, in subsequent sentences, the
      article &quot;the&quot; is used
      instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>EXAMPLE:</p>
    <p>
      He would like to live in a large house. The house should have at least
      three bedrooms and two
      bathrooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      (NOTE: In the first sentence (first mention), &quot;a&quot; is used
      because it is referring to a non specified house. In the second sentence,
      &quot;the&quot; is used because now the house has been specified.)

            In this sentence, &quot;book&quot; is a singular, countable noun. It
            is also specific because of the phrase &ldquo;that I read last

    <p>3. In general, use &quot;the&quot; with plural proper nouns.</p>
    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <p>the Great Lakes</p>
    <p>the French</p>
    <p>the Rockies (as in the Rocky Mountains)</p>

    <p>
      4. &quot;The&quot; is often used with proper nouns that include an
      &ldquo;of&rdquo; phrase.
    </p>
    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <p>the United States of America</p>
    <p>the University of Minnesota</p>
    <p>the International Swimming Hall of Fame</p>

    <p>
      5. Use &quot;the&quot; when the noun being referred to is unique because
      of our understanding of the world.
    </p>
    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <p>The Earth moves around the sun.</p>
    <p>Wolves howl at the moon.</p>

    <p>
      6. Use &quot;the&quot; when a noun can be made specific from a previous
      mention in the text. This is also known as second or subsequent mention.
    </p>
    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <p>
      My son bought a cat. I am looking after the cat while he is on vacation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I read a good book. The book was about how to use articles correctly in
      English.
    </p>

    <p>
      7. &quot;The&quot; is used with superlative adjectives, which are
      necessarily unique (the first, the second, the biggest, the smallest, the
      next, the only, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <p>It was the first study to address the issue.</p>
    <p>She was the weakest participant.</p>
    <p>He was the only person to drop out of the study.</p>
