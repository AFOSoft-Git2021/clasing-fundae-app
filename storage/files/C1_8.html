	<h1>PERFECT INFINITIVE:&nbsp; (to)
have + past participle.</h1>

</p>
<p>The
perfect infinitive is most commonly found in type 3 conditional
sentences as part of the conditional perfect, although it can be used
in other places as well. The perfect infinitive is formed: to have +
past participle.</p>

<p>As
with the present infinitive, there are situations where the zero form
of the perfect infinitive is required, so the word to is omitted.
This happens after most modal auxiliaries, and in other places where
zero infinitives are used.</p>

<p>The
perfect infinitive often refers to things that might have <b>happened
in the past.</b>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>You seem</span><b> to have annoyed</b>him</span></p>
	<li><p>It was a mistake <b>to have done</b> everything.</p>
</ul>

<p>But
perfect infinitive can <b>also</b>
refer to something that will be completed<b>
at a point in the future</b>:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>We
	hope </span><b>to
	have finished</b>
	the car repair by the end of May.</span></p>
	<li><p>The
	company <i>hopes</i>
	with great expectations <b>to
	have finished </b>its
	restructuring by April.</p>
</ul>
