      Past continuous
    </h1>
    <p>
      The Past Continuous tense is an important tense in English. We use it
        to say what we were in the middle of doing at a particular moment in the
        past.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that continuous tenses are also called progressive tenses. So the
        Past Continuous tense is sometimes called the Past Progressive
        tense.
    </p>

    <p>
      The past continuous is formed using was/were + present participle.
        Questions are indicated by inverting the subject and was/were. Negatives
        are made with not.

      The structure of the past continuous tense is:
    </p>

    <table >
      <tr>

    </table>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The auxiliary verb (be) is conjugated in the Past Simple: was,
          were
      </li>
      <li>
        The main verb is invariable in present participle form: -ing
      </li>
      <li>
        For negative sentences we insert not between the auxiliary verb and
          the main verb.
      </li>
      <li>
        For question sentences, we exchange the subject and the auxiliary
          verb.

    <h2>
      How do we use the Past Continuous tense?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Interrupted Action in the Past
    </h3>

    <p>
      Use the past continuous to indicate that a longer action in the past
        was interrupted. The interruption is usually a shorter action in the
        simple past. Remember this can be a real interruption or just an
        interruption in time.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        I was watching TV when she called.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the phone rang, she was writing a letter.
      </li>
      <li>
        While we were having the picnic, it started to rain.
      </li>
      <li>
        What were you doing when the earthquake started?
      </li>
      <li>
        I was listening to my iPod, so I didn&#39;t hear the fire
          alarm.
      </li>
      <li>
        You were not listening to me when I told you to turn the oven
          off.
      </li>
      <li>
        While John was sleeping last night, someone stole his car.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sammy was waiting for us when we got off the plane.
      </li>
      <li>
        While I was writing the email, the computer suddenly went off.
      </li>
      <li>
        A: What were you doing when you broke your leg?
      </li>.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="-break"></div>
    <h3>
      Specific Time as an Interruption
    </h3>
    <p>
      The past continuous is interrupted by a shorter action in the simple
        past. However, you can also use a specific time as an
        interruption.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Last night at 6 PM, I was eating dinner.
      </li>
      <li>
        At midnight, we were still driving through the desert.
      </li>
      <li>
        Yesterday at this time, I was sitting at my desk at work.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In the simple past, a specific time is used to show when an action
        began or finished. In the past continuous, a specific time only
        interrupts the action.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Last night at 6 PM, I ate dinner.
      </li>
      <li>I started eating at 6 PM.</li>
      <li>
        Last night at 6 PM, I was eating dinner.
      </li>
      <li>
        I started earlier; and at 6 PM, I was in the process of eating
          dinner.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="-break"></div>
    <h3>Parallel Actions</h3>
    <p>
      When you use the past continuous with two actions in the same sentence,
        it expresses the idea that both actions were happening at the same time.
        The actions are parallel.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        I was studying while he was making dinner.
      </li>
      <li>
        While Ellen was reading, Tim was watching television.
      </li>
      <li>
        Were you listening while he was talking?
      </li>
      <li>
        I wasn&#39;t paying attention while I was writing the letter, so I
          made several mistakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        What were you doing while you were waiting?
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>

          time
      </li>
