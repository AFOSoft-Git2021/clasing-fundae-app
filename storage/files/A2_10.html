      Like &amp; Dislike
    </h1>
    <p>
      There are a lot of ways to talk about preferences in English but one of
        the easiest is by using the verb &lsquo;to like&lsquo;.
    </p>
    <div class="-break"></div>
    <h2>Likes</h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like&rsquo; is a very versatile regular verb in English and can
        be used express preferences.
    </p>
    <p>I like ice cream.</p>
    <p>I like going to the movies.</p>
    <p>I like you!</p>
    <p>
      You can also use it in the negative with &lsquo;do not&lsquo;
    </p>
    <p>I don&rsquo;t like ice cream.</p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t like going to the movies.
    </p>
    <p>I don&rsquo;t like you!</p>
    <p>
      To ask other people questions about their preferences:
    </p>
    <p>Do you like ice cream?</p>
    <p>Do you like going to the movies?</p>
    <p>Do you like me?</p>
    <h2>Dislike</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to use &lsquo;dislike&lsquo; to express a negative
        preference it is also very easy but perhaps not as usual in spoken
        English.
    </p>
    <p>I dislike ice cream.</p>
    <p>I dislike going to the movies.</p>
    <p>Do you dislike me?</p>

    <h2>
      Things to remember about likes and dislikes:
    </h2>
    <p>
      1. When these expressions are followed by a verb, the latter is put in
        the -ing form.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        &quot;I like listening to music.&quot;
      </li>
      <li>
        &quot;I hate wearing sunglasses.&quot;
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      2. Note that&quot; very much&quot; &amp; &quot; a lot&quot; always come
        after the things you like.
    </p>
    <p>
      CORRECT: I like basketball very much.
    </p>
    <p>CORRECT: I like basketball a lot.</p>
    <p>
      WRONG: I like very much basketball.
    </p>
    <p>WRON</p>
    <p>G: I like a lot basketball.</p>
    <p>
      3. Be careful when you use &quot;I don&#39;t mind...&quot;. Although
        it&#39;s in a negative form, it means that you neither like nor dislike
        something
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>SPEAKER 1: Do you mind playing football?
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>SPEAKER 2: No, I don&#39;t mind.
      </li>
    </ul>
