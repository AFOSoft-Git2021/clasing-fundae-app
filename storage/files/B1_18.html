    <h1>Must, Could, Should and Would have</h1>

    <h2>Must have</h2>
    <p>When something certainly happened &nbsp;(certainty)</p>
    <p>
      When we expressed certainty about an event or state, in the past we use
      &nbsp;&ldquo;must have&rdquo;:
    </p>
    <p>MUST + HAVE + PAST PARTICIPLE</p>

    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You must have been tired.</li>
      <li>He must have gone home. &nbsp;</li>
      <li>
        There&rsquo;s no milk in the refrigerator. &nbsp;We must have drunk it
        all.
      </li>
      <li>
        Many more cars than usual were parked on our street last night.
        &nbsp;Someone must have had a party.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="-break"></div>
    <h2>Could have</h2>
    <p>
      Use could have to talk about possibilities if something had been different
      in the past.
    </p>
    <p>COULD + HAVE + PAST PARTICIPLE</p>

    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If I had gone to college, I could have gotten a better job.</li>
      <li>
        She could have won the gold medal if she hadn&rsquo;t fallen three
        times.
      </li>
      <li>I could have lost the keys in the pub. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
      <li>He could have got stuck in traffic.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="-break"></div>
    <h2>Should have</h2>
    <p>
      Use should have to say that a different action was recommended in the
      past.
    </p>
    <p>SHOULD + HAVE + PAST PARTICIPLE</p>

    <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You should have gone there straight away.</li>
      <li>I was so worried about you. You should have called!</li>
      <li>
        I&rsquo;m sorry that I&rsquo;m late for work. I should have woken up
        earlier.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="-break"></div>
    <h2>Would have</h2>
    <p>
      Use would have to imagine a result&nbsp;(if something had been different
      in the past)
    </p>
    <p>WOULD + HAVE + PAST PARTICIPLE</p>

    <p>
      Would have is a bit more difficult because it has two&nbsp;common
      structures. The first is with but.
    </p>
    <p>1. To talk about something you wanted to do but didn&rsquo;t</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I would have&nbsp;gone to the party, but&nbsp;I was really busy.</li>
      <li>
        I would have&nbsp;called you, but&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t know your number.
      </li>
      <li>
        I would have&nbsp;loaned you the money, but&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t have
        any.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>2. Part of the third conditional</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If I had had enough money, I would have&nbsp;bought a car</li>
      <li>
        If I had known they were vegetarians, I would have&nbsp;made a salad.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="-break"></div>
