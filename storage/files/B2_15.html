    <h1>Wish with infinitive verbs </h1>

    <h2>(wish + to + verb)</h2>

    <p>This means &quot;would like&quot;. It is used in very formal contexts.</p>
    <p>Be careful with the continuous tenses because they are not usually used in this
        case.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>&ldquo;I wish to see him before the show.&rdquo;</li>
        <li>&ldquo;Wish + to + Verb (Infinitive)&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>


    <p>When we use wish followed by a verb in the to-infinitive form, wish means the same as
        want, but it is more formal. We do not normally use wish in the continuous form when we use it with a
        to-infinitive:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>&ldquo;I wish to speak to Mr Hennessy, please.&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>


    <p>We don&rsquo;t use a that-clause after wish when it is a more formal version of
        want:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>&ldquo;I wish to visit you in the summer, if
            possible.&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>


    <p>We can use an object (underlined), before the to-infinitive:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>&ldquo;I did not wish my family to know about Sara, so I told
            them nothing.&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When we use an object after wish, we must also use a verb in the to-infinitive form.
        Alternatively, we can say want or (more politely) would like:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>&ldquo;We wish to have a table near the window, please.&rdquo;
            (or We would like a table near the window, please.)</li>
    </ul>
