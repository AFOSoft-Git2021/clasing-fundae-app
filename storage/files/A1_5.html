    <h1>Years/Dates</h1>

    <h2>How are the year dates written in English?</h2>

    <p>One significant point when writing the year dates in English is: The year is
        always preceded by the preposition &lsquo;in&rsquo;. This feature is particularly important for English
        language learners, as this preposition may not be the rule in other languages.</p>

    <p>a. The preposition &lsquo;in&rsquo; comes before the year in English (if no month
        is mentioned before)
    </p>    
    <ul>
        <li>In 1995, I won the lottery.</li>
        <li>I moved to Australia in 2003.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>b. If a month appears before the year, &lsquo;in&rsquo; is used before the
        Month.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My sister got her first car in February 1998.</li>        
    </ul>

    <p>c. Furthermore, year dates may be complemented with &lsquo;before&rsquo; or
        &lsquo;after Christ&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Before Christ &rarr; BC or B.C. (Before Christ)</li>
        <li>After Christ &rarr; AD or A.D. (Anno Domini)</li>
        <li>The tomb was discovered in 2147 BC.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How are the years pronounced in English?</h2>

    <p>The pronunciation of the years in English has only few rules. Up to and including
        1999, the years are spoken as hundreds. For shortening, &lsquo;hundred and&rsquo; may also be omitted.
        Compare these possibilities of pronouncing the dates:</p>

    <p>1. In English, year dates can be pronounced in the following ways. For
        example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the year 1972:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>nineteen hundred and seventy-two or;</li>
            <li>nineteen seventy-two</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>the year 1854:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>eighteen hundred and fifty-four or;</li>
            <li>eighteen fifty-four</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>
        2. From the year 2000 onwards, the year is spoken just like a regular basic number
        and not as hundreds anymore. Examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>2000 &rarr; two thousand</li>
        <li>2005 &rarr; two thousand and five</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3. In colloquial language, it is common to pronounce the years in groups of two.
        Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2003 &rarr; twenty oh three</li>
        <li>2012 &rarr; twenty twelve</li>
        <li>2023 &rarr; twenty twenty-three</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Writing the date</h2>
    <p>We write the date in English in different ways. The most common way in British English is to
        write the day of the month first, then the month (starting with a capital letter) and then the year.
        Example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>20 January 1993</li>
        <li>14 November 2005</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We can also write the date in numbers only. Example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>20 January 1993 &rarr; 20/1/1993</li>
        <li>14 November 2005 &rarr; 14&ndash;11&ndash;2005 or 14.11.05
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Sometimes the last two letters of the number as spoken can be used (th, rd, st,
        nd). Example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Today is the 7th September.</li>
        <li>The grand opening is on 1st June. or &hellip; on June 1st.
        </li>
    </ul>
