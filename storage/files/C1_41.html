	<h1>Casual Slang </h1>

	<p> Slang is vocabulary that is used between people who belong to the same
		social group and who know each other well. Slang is very informal
		language. It can offend people if it is used about other people or
		outside a group of people who know each other well. We usually use
		slang in speaking rather than writing.
