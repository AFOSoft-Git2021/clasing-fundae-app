	<h1>Adjective - different meaning
		depending on the context:
	</h1>

	<h2>MEANING
		OF AN ADJECTIVES &ldquo;DUE&rdquo;</h2>

	<p>Adjective
		&ldquo;due&ldquo; expressing time and date can appear in a sentence
		containing an infinitive &ldquo;to&ldquo;:


	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>The
				concert is due to begin in 10 minutes.


			</p>
	</ul>

	<p>Adjective
		&ldquo;due&ldquo; expressing time and date can also appear in a
		sentence without a verb:


	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>The
				concert is due at eight.


			</p>
	</ul>

	<p>Due
		to&rdquo; is an expression helping define effect where &ldquo;to&rdquo;
		is a preposition and not a part of the infinitive.


	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>The
				accident was due to his recklessness.


			</p>
	</ul>

	<h2>MEANING
		OF AN ADJECTIVES &ldquo;ANXIOUS&rdquo;</h2>

	<p>Adjective
		&ldquo;anxious&ldquo; has different meanings depending on the used
		structure.


	</p>

	<p>If
		there is a preposition &ldquo;about&ldquo; and a noun or a pronoun
		after an adjective, it must be dealing with the word meaning
		&ldquo;worried&rdquo;.


	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>She
				was anxious about her son.&nbsp;


			</p>
	</ul>

	<p>Use
		of an infinitive with&ldquo;to&rdquo; (optionally preposition &ldquo;for&rdquo;)
		helps express wishes and aspirations.


	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>She
				was very anxious for him to leave.


			</p>
	</ul>

	<p>In
		a formal language, it is possible to replace this structure with
		anxious + that&hellip; should.


	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>The
				president was anxious that the bill should be adopted.


			</p>
	</ul>

	<h2>MEANING
		OF AN ADJECTIVES &ldquo;CONSCIOUS&rdquo;</h2>

	<p>Adjective
		&ldquo;conscious&rdquo; used independently in a sentence relates to
		physical state and means &ldquo;aware of&rdquo;:


	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>She
				was conscious in spite of the pain.


			</p>
	</ul>

	<p>Structures
		conscious + that or conscious of + -ing express &ldquo;aware of &ldquo;.


	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>I
				was conscious that somebody was following me.


			</p>
		<li>
			<p>I
				was conscious of being followed.&nbsp;


			</p>
	</ul>

	<p>You
		can use the past infinitive in these sentences:


	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>I
				was conscious of having been followed.


			</p>
	</ul>
